<p>Bahaism is a revolt from the fold of Islam which
in recent years has been bidding vigorously for the
support of Occidental minds. Many of its principles
are culled from the Christian religion which it
insidiously seeks to supplant. What this Oriental
cult is, what it stands for, and what it aims at, is
told in a volume which forms a notable addition
to the History of Comparative Religions.</p>

<p>"Not only a valuable contribution to the missionary
literature of modern times, but is, in addition,
a volume rich in the facts it contains in
regard to that historic country. The American
people generally should read this book, and
thereby acquire much needed information about

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="dropcap">AMONG movements in the Mohammedan
world in modern times Babi-Bahaism is
one of the most interesting. It is a definite
revolt from Islam within its own fold. It has won
its way in Persia amid considerable persecution to a
position as a separate religion. It has added another
to the permanent sects of the Near East. There
Christian missions, inspired to long-postponed effort
to convert Mohammedanism, have come face to face
with Bahaism as a new and aggressive force. It has
laid out a program as a universal religion, has
crossed the seas and aspires to convert Christendom.
Interest in it has been increased by this
propaganda in the West and by the visits to Europe
for this purpose of its present head, Abdul Baha
Abbas, in 1911 and 1912.</p>

<p>Besides those who are interested in Bahaism as
students of history and comparative religions, there
are several classes who have shown marked favour
to Bahaism.</p>

<p>(1) One class are simply bent on seeking some
novelty. They are well described by the <i>Egyptian
Gazette</i>, of Alexandria, in speaking of the reception
of Abdul Baha in London: "About the London
meetings there was a certain air of gush and self-advertisement
on the part of Baha's friends, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was quite patent to all who are familiar with that
kind of religion which will listen to anything so long
as it is unorthodox, new, and sensational."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>(2)  Another class are believers in the truth of all
great religions, and, with a vague pantheistic notion,
recognize all great men as God-inspired. They are
willing to put Baha Ullah and Abdul Baha on the
list of true religious leaders. Such is Rev. R.J.
Campbell, who, in receiving Abdul Baha in London,
spoke of the "diverse religious faiths that are all
aspects of the one religion," and of the services as
"a wonderful manifestation of the Spirit of God."
He said to the congregation: "We as followers of
the Lord Jesus Christ, who is to us and always will
be the Light of the World, give greeting to Abdul
Baha."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell gives opportunity to the Bahai
propaganda in the <i>Christian Commonwealth</i>, and
has enlisted Abdul Baha as a contributor.</p>

<p>(3) Another class look on Bahaism as an ethical
system, and Baha and Abdul Baha as world teachers.
Their relation to Christ has been only that of a disciple
to a teacher of morals. They recognize in
Baha a new schoolmaster. Being Bahais to them
consists in admiration of certain principles on which
Abdul Baha is in the habit of dilating. But these
are not Bahaism any more than Romans xii.-xv.
are Pauline Christianity. Paul's gospel is Romans
i.-viii. In its moral precepts and social principles,
Bahaism is a borrower from Christ's teaching, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sometimes from Mohammed. However, Bahaism is
a religion, not a system of morals.</p>

<p>(4) Some adherents regard Bahaism as Christianity
continued or renewed by the Second Coming
of Christ, whom they recognize in Abdul Baha.
Most American Bahais are of this class, with faith in
Baha Ullah as God the Father.</p>

<p>How can I classify the late Prof. T. K. Cheyne of
Oxford? This widely known critic in his last work
(1914), "The Reconciliation of Races and Religions,"
bewilders me by his credulity. It is only
charitable to excuse it as the product of his dotage.
How otherwise could an Oxford scholar take pride
in adopting the "new name" and titles given to
him by Abdul Baha, sign his preface "Ruhani,"
Spiritual, and have pleasure in being called the "divine
philosopher," "priest of the Prince of Peace
(Baha)," and being compared to St. Paul as a herald
of the Kingdom, and write himself a "member of
the Bahai community." At the same time Doctor
Cheyne wrote himself down as a "member of the
Nava Vidhan, Lahore" (Brahma-Samaj).</p>

<p>At present there are Bahai congregations in sixteen
of the United States, in Canada, Hawaii, South Africa,
England, Germany and Russia, as well as in India
and Burmah. The future of its propaganda in Christendom
lacks promise. Yet its measure of success
makes it desirable to examine its claims and the facts
regarding them.</p>

<p>Fortunately besides the older Babi books, there
is an abundance of Bahai literature. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
(1) Treatises of Baha Ullah, (2) Tablets (Letters) and
Addresses of Abdul Baha, (3) Persian Narratives,
(4) Evidential books and tracts by its propagators,
(5) Narratives of pilgrimages to Acca. From an
independent point of view, little has been written.
Nearly all of the many articles which have appeared
in periodical literature have been from the pens of
Bahais, though often not so ostensibly. Prof. E. G.
Browne of Cambridge University, England, has
translated and edited important Babi-Bahai works.
His Introductions, Notes and Appendices to these
books are storehouses of erudition and enable the
reader to correct the biased information of the text.
They pertain for the most part to the Babi period.
So do the able contributions of Mr. A. L. M. Nicolas,
the Consul of France, with whom, as my neighbour
at Tabriz, I have had the pleasure of valuable conversations
on this subject on which he is such an authority.
I have had as sources of information also
a manuscript "Life of Baha Ullah" by Mohammed
Javad Kasvini, the "Kitab-ul-Akdas," Most Holy
Book, translated by Dr. I. G. Kheiralla, in manuscript,
and various unpublished letters and documents.
Besides all this, I have been in personal
contact with Bahais in Persia for a generation. My
language teachers were Bahais, one of them a convert
to Christianity. I have found their journal, the
<i>Star of the West</i>, a prolific source of information. I
may claim not to be of the class referred to by Abdul
Baha when he says, "Baha Ullah will be assailed by
those who are not informed of his principles."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>After sketching, in brief, the history of Bahaism I
will examine its religious, moral, political and social
doctrine and life. In doing this I shall quote for the
most part from the words of the "Revelation" and
its adherents, in order to insure fairness and justice.
In the course of the investigation, the history and
character of the founders will be considered. Finally
I shall describe its propaganda in the Occident.</p>

<p>Bahais declare that Babism is abrogated and
superseded. In reality it is dead and I do not treat
of it, except as it throws light on the history or
doctrines of Bahaism. To all intents and purposes,
the Bab is as much an obsolete prophet as Mani or
Babak.</p>

<p>I am to deal with Bahaism in its latest phases.
The term Babi is not appropriate to the religion of
Baha nor to his followers. Of the "revelation," it
may be said as Jacob said of his wages, they "have
changed them ten times." The Bab altered his
declarations regarding himself and his statements
of doctrine. Subh-i-Azal made further changes.
Baha's standpoint in the "Ikan," at Bagdad, differs
greatly from that in the "Kitab-ul-Akdas," at Acca.
Abbas gave the kaleidoscope another whirl and
added his interpretations and emendations. Besides
all these, it has been given a Western aspect for
Christians. The Rev. H. H. Jessup, D. D., compares
it very aptly to the town clock in Beirut, which
has two kinds of dial plates. The face turned towards
the Moslem quarter has the hands set to tell the hour
according to Oriental reckoning; the face towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Christian quarter, according to the European
day. It is the face towards the Christians that I
shall look at specially in the present investigation.
However historical facts are the same and the main
doctrines taught in the West have no essential difference
from those of Persian Bahaism.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Does it often happen that the earliest records of a religious movement
... pass, within a short time after their completion,
into the hands of strangers who, while interested in their preservation,
have no desire to alter them for better or worse. So far as my
knowledge goes, it has never happened save in the case of the Babi
religion.&mdash;<i>"The New History of the Bab," p. xi, by E. G. Browne.</i></p>

<p>Persia is, and always has been, a very hotbed of systems from the
time of Manes and Mazdak in the old Sassanian days, down to the
present age, which has brought into being the Babis and the Sheikhis.&mdash;<i>"A
Year Among the Persians," p. 122.</i></p>

<p>Outside of a certain mixture of Occidental science and philanthropy,
introduced largely for foreign consumption and in order to
give an up-to-date stamp or colouring to the movement, there is
scarcely anything that distinguishes Babism from its predecessors.
The materials are inextricably interwoven with the whole course
of Persian history in all its departments, political, religious, social,
and philosophical. Time has pronounced its verdict again and
again in the most unmistakable manner. So deep a hold have the
ideas, which lie at the foundation of Babism and similar sects, taken
of the minds and hearts of the people, that it may be said that as
every American is a possible president, so every Persian is a possible
murshid. For every sect that makes its appearance on the
page of history, there are hundreds of embryo sects, of whose existence
no one knows outside of a very limited circle.&mdash;<i>P. Z. Easton,
quoted in Speer's "Missions and Modern History," Vol. I, p. 121.</i></p>

<p>For the Bahais, the Bab became a sort of John the Baptist, sent
to announce to the world the coming of Mirza Husain Ali, Baha
Ullah, and perhaps of Abbas Effendi&mdash;a pitiable result of martyrdom.
This thesis is essentially false. Reading of the book (the
"Bayan") will convince every one of this.&mdash;<i>A. L. M. Nicolas,

<p class="dropcap">THE soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> of the East has been fertile of religions.
Montanus, Manes, Mazdak, Babak,
Mukanna&mdash;familiarized in Lalla Rookh as
the Veiled prophet of Khorasan,&mdash;Hasan Sabah chief
of the Assassins, Hakim the cruel God of the Druses,
each of these propagated his doctrines, exerted a wide
influence, and left his mark on the people of the
Orient. Saad-i-Doulah the Jew, Argoon Khan the
Mongol, Ala-i-Din al Khalig, king of Delhi, and
many others attempted to found new religions. In
our own day the Mahdi of the Sudan, Ahmad Quadiani
of India and Sheikh Ali Nur-i-Din of Tunis entered
the lists. In the West, too, in America a land
unbridled by traditions, Mormonism, Dowieism and
Christian Science have flourished. To all these must
be added Babism and Bahaism.</p>

<p>As an introduction to a discussion of Bahaism and
its claims, I will sketch briefly and simply its origin
and history. Bahaism is derived from Babism. Babism
has its roots in Shiahism, a soil impregnated
with the doctrines of the Imamate and Mahdiism.
The atmosphere is filled with millennial hopes and
dreamy mysticism, with Sufi philosophies and allegorical
fancies of its poets. This soil has been fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>ful of many sects. The Shiahism of Persia is called
the "Religion of the Twelve" because its fundamental
doctrine is that the twelve Imams, the lineal
descendants of Ali and Fatima, the daughter of Mohammed,
were the rightful Caliphs of Islam, in succession
to Mohammed. In the tenth century (329
<span class="smcap">A. H.</span> or 940 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>) the Twelfth Imam disappeared
into a well, and still lives in Jabulka or Jabulsa
whence he is expected to reappear as the Mahdi or
Kaim. After his concealment, four persons in succession
were channels of communication between
him and the faithful. The title given to these was
Bab or the Gate.</p>

<p>Among the sects which sprang up among the
Shiahs or were related to them were the Ismielis,
Carmathians, Druses, Hurufis, Ali-Allahis or Nusairiyeh,
Assassins, Batinis and many others. A group
of these were called Ghulat, because they rendered
excessive honour to the Imams, believing them to be
incarnations of the attributes or essence of God.
Those holding this view anticipated that the Imam
Mahdi would be a divine Manifestation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> At the beginning
of the nineteenth century, a sect arose in
Persia, called Sheikhis. It received its name from
its founder, Sheikh Ahmad of Ahsa, 1752-1827. He
taught that there was always in the world a "perfect</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>Shiah," who held communication with the absent
Imam and revealed his will. Sheikh Ahmad was
that "perfect one." He was favoured by the Kajar
Shahs and had a considerable following. His successor,
Haji Kazim of Resht, near the time of his
death, announced to his disciples at Kerbela that the
Manifestation was at hand. One of his disciples was
Mirza Ali Mohammed of Shiraz. When twenty-four
years of age in 1844, he laid claim to be the "promised
one." He took the title of "Bab," the Gate or
Door of communication of the knowledge of God.
His followers were called Babis. He soon advanced
his station and claimed to be the Kaim or Mahdi.
Still advancing he took the title of <i>Nukta</i> or Point of
Divine Unity and announced his "Revelation" or
"Bayan" as the abrogation of Islam and the Koran.
From Shiraz he went to Mecca and proclaimed his
manifestation. On his return he was imprisoned.
Many of the Sheikhis became his zealous followers
and by their active propaganda caused great agitation
throughout Persia. The Bab was transferred to
the extreme northwest of Persia and confined in
prison at Maku and Chirik. His sectaries, oppressed
and persecuted, rose in arms against Mohammed
Shah, anticipating victory through divine interposition.
The Bab was executed at Tabriz in 1850. The
insurrections were put down and many of the brave
captives were treacherously slaughtered. A few
Babis, seeking revenge, attempted to assassinate
the new Shah, Nasr-ud-Din. This led to cruel reprisals.
Four score Babis were executed at Teheran.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Others fled into exile, especially to Bagdad. Among
these was Mirza Yahya whom the Bab had appointed
his successor. His title was Subh-i-Azal, the Dawn
of the Eternal, or His Holiness the Eternal.</p>

<p>A special point of the Bab's teaching was the announcement
of the coming of "Him whom God
should manifest." After his death a number of the
Babis claimed to be the promised incarnation. There
was a "chaos of divine manifestations," including
Hazret Zahib, Janab-i-Azim, Nabil and others.
Among these claimants was Mirza Husain Ali, a
son of Mirza Abbas, surnamed Buzurk, and his concubine.
The father was steward or "vizier" of the
household of Imam Werdi Mirza, Governor of Teheran.
He was half brother to Mirza Yahya and
thirteen years his senior. His title was Baha Ullah,
the splendour or glory of God. For many years Baha
acted in Bagdad (1852-67) as factotum for Azal, and
acknowledged him as supreme. Then he announced
that he himself was "He whom God should manifest,"
and took active measures to supplant Azal.
About this time the Turkish Government transferred
them to Adrianople. Here developed bitter jealousies,
quarrels and foul play. The Sultan intervened
and sent Subh-i-Azal to Famagusta, Cyprus,
and Baha Ullah to Acca<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> (Acre), Syria, August 1868.
Both were granted pensions and kept under police
surveillance as parties dangerous to religion and the</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>state. Azal continued to be the head of the Babis,
called henceforth also Azalis. Baha attracted most
of the Babis to himself, and they became known as
Bahais. Baha relegated the Bab to the position of a
forerunner, and declared the "Bayan" and other
books of the Bab to be superseded by his own
"Revelations." He changed in a measure the doctrines
and laws of Babism, liberalizing its provisions.
He put himself forward as the Lord of a new dispensation,
the founder of a new religion.</p>

<p>During the next quarter of a century Bahaism
made little stir in Persia. Its advancement was by
no means as rapid as during the earlier years of the
Bab. The zeal and devotion of the followers sensibly
slackened. <i>Tagiya</i> (dissimulation regarding
one's religion) was allowed and practiced. The
fierce warriors turned to professing the doctrines of
expediency, condemning as unwise zealots the fighting
Babis of the previous generation. During these
years they escaped bloody persecutions except in
rare instances. They tried to make their peace with
the Shah, constantly emphasizing their loyalty, expurgating
their books to suppress condemnation of
the dynasty, and inducing the Sadr-Azam, the Prime
Minister of Nasr-i-Din Shah, to tolerate and befriend
them.</p>

<p>In Acca, too, Baha soon acquired considerable
freedom, built a palace, called Bahja, in a delightful
garden and freely received the pilgrims. He sent
out many tablets, composed his Books of Revelation
and had them published in Bombay. He died at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Acca in May, 1892, in his seventy-fifth year. His
temple tomb is near the Bahja.</p>

<p>Baha's haram consisted of two wives and a concubine.
After his death, the sons of the different
wives quarrelled regarding the succession. Abbas
Effendi, the only son of the oldest wife, proclaimed
himself the successor, the Interpreter, the Centre of
the Covenant, the Source of Authority. Mohammed
Ali and his brothers strenuously opposed Abbas and
intense animosity was engendered which divided the
followers in Acca and Persia. Abbas drew the
greater number with him. He assumed the title
of Abdul Baha (Servant of Baha). He has the ambition
to make the faith a world religion and has
inaugurated a propaganda in the West. After the
proclamation of constitutional liberty in Turkey, he
resided in Egypt. Later he made several journeys
to Europe and one to North America. His visit to
the Occident brought him into the lime-light. He
was given good opportunity to present his cause.</p>

<p>The addresses of this "Infallible Interpreter" of
the cult did not reveal clearly the real doctrines and
aim of the movement. Abdul Baha confined himself
mainly to the utterance of popular platitudes such as
are stock-in-trade for a multitude of social and religious
reformers, and most of which are original
and accepted principles and precepts of Christianity.
The real claims of Bahaism are set forth in the Books
and Tablets (Epistles) of Baha Ullah and Abdul Baha,
and in a considerable literature by Persian and American
Bahais.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Abdul Baha is an intelligent, well informed man,
of fair sagacity. He was educated at home after the
custom of Persia. He says of himself, "I have studied
Arabic profoundly and know the Arabic better
than the Arabians themselves. I have studied the
Persian and Turkish in my native land, besides other
languages of the East. But when I visit the West I
need an interpreter."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> He said to Doctor Jessup,
"Yes, I know your Beirut Press and your books."
His references to ancient and modern philosophers,
to historical events and to European writers, quoting
from the same, show some familiarity with literature.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
He repudiates the claims of some of his disciples
that he has no literary culture, as that of Abul
Fazl<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> or of M. A. Lucas who says:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> "He has had
no access to books, yet his knowledge is unbounded."
On this point Professor Cheyne remarks:<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> "His
public addresses prove that through this and that
channel he has imbibed something of humanistic
and even scientific culture. He must have had
some one to guide him in the tracks of modern
inquiry. I venture to hope that his expounding
may not, in the future, extend to philosophic, philological,
scientific, and exegetical details. Abdul
Baha may fall into error on secular problems, among
which it is obvious to include Biblical and Koranic
exegesis." "I am bound to say that Baha Ullah has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
made mistakes and the almost equally venerated
Abdul Baha has made many slips."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>A word should be said about the number of Bahais.
I have many data on this point, but can here give
only a summary. Regarding their numbers, the
Bahais have indulged in gross exaggeration. "Millions"
is the usual figure used by American Bahais.
Thus Phelps<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> speaks of "the millions of Bahais in
Persia." MacNutt, in "Unity through Love," declares
that "His followers number millions from
all the religious systems of the world." Kheiralla<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
says: "Abdul Karim, 1896, assured me that the believers
in Baha were fifty millions. I wrote to Syria
to ask. Sayid Mohammed, secretary of Abbas
Effendi, said that the number was fifty-five million
souls." Kheiralla afterwards denounces it as a
gross deceit. As to Persia, they place the proportion
at one-third or one-half. Dreyfus writes,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
"Probably half the population of Persia is Bahai."
Some judicious non-Bahai writers allow them half a
million or less in Persia on a basis of ten millions of
population. American missionaries, as Jordan at
Teheran, Frame at Resht and Shedd at Urumia,
calculate that the number in Persia does not exceed
100,000 to 200,000. After careful inquiry I agree
with this estimate.</p>

<p>As to other races and countries, let us see. Abul
Fazl claims<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> that "Jews, Zoroastrians, and Nusaireyah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
by thousands" are Bahais. M. Haidar Ali<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> says:
"The majority of Zoroastrians are recognized as
Bahais in all sincerity." On the contrary Professor
Browne writes:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> "I had been informed that Zoroastrians
were accepting Bahaism. However after
much intercourse with the Zoroastrians of Yezd and
Kerman for the space of three and a half months, I
came to the conclusion that few, if any, had adopted
the Bahai creed." In India the proportion of Parsee-Bahais
is very small.</p>

<p>As to Jews:&mdash;Remey says: "In Hamadan there
is a large Israelitish following of Baha." A census
made by a European Jew showed exactly 59 parents
and with their children 194 persons out of a
population of 6,000 Jews. As to the United States,
I give some particulars in the closing chapter. The
census of 1906 reported 1,280 Bahais, which may
have increased to two or three thousand. In the
Turkish empire they are few, for Sunni Moslems are
utterly indifferent to Bahaism. The Egyptian <i>Gazette</i>
says of Egypt where Abdul Baha resided for
two years, "The new religion has made little perceptible
progress; Islam remained indifferent, and
the Christian community was ignorant of his presence."
Of Syria, Mr. Phelps wrote:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> "All the Bahais
in Acca are Persians. No other nationalities are
among them." The inference is plain that no native
of Acca had become Bahai through forty years of
contact with Baha and his seventy followers. Bahais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
outside of Persia are probably all told not more than
15,000 and one-third of these are Persians in Russia.
Abdul Baha gave the impression that many of the
Christians of Persia are converts to Baha. Dr. J. H.
Shedd wrote, 1894, "I have heard of no case of a
Christian conversion to Bahaism." Dr. G. W.
Holmes wrote, 1903, "I do not know of a single
Christian in Persia, who has been converted to
Bahaism. Some Bahais who made a profession of
Christianity turned back to Baha." Rev. J. W.
Hawkes declares that in his observation none of the
members of the Syrian (Nestorian) or Armenian
churches in Persia have become Bahais.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> I have
known of one Armenian family in Resht and two
men in Maraga, one of whom was a notorious ne'er-do-well,
who kept up his opium using as before.</p>

<p class="h2">The General Claims of Bahaism</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>The conception on which Bahaism bases its claim is false.
Truth does not grow old, nor is it possible to change the religion
with the growth of the race. A universal religion must present
truth in a form that will reach men in every stage of civilization,
for the reason that in every period of the world since the dawn of
history there have been simultaneously men in every stage of intellectual
development.&mdash;<i>W. A. Shedd in "Miss. Review of the
World."</i></p>

<p>It (Bahaism) has not enough assurance of personal immortality
to satisfy such Western minds as are repelled by the barren and
jejune ethical systems of agnostics, positivists, and humanitarians
who would give us rules to regulate a life which they have rendered
meaningless.&mdash;<i>Professor Browne in Phelps' "Life of Abbas
Effendi," p. xviii.</i></p>

<p>The essence of being a Bahai is a boundless devotion to the
person of the Manifestation and a profound belief that he is divine
and of a different order from all other beings.&mdash;<i>Professor Browne,
Art. "Bab" in Ency. of Religion and Ethics.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">THE claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> of Bahaism are many and varied.
They cover a wide range. I will first consider
its general claims and of these the
most significant.</p>

<p>I. First of all, Bahais claim that a new religion is
needed. All the great religions, they say, were true
in their day; not only Moses, Christ, and Mohammed,
but Zoroaster, Confucius, and Buddha were Divine
Manifestations, and revealed God's truth. But now
the old religions are dead. Abdul Baha<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> says:
"The Spirit has passed away from the bodies of
the old religions. While the forms of their doctrines
remain, the Spirit has fled." "The principles of the
religion<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> of Christ have been forgotten. It is then
clear and evident that in the passage of time religions
become entirely changed. Therefore they are renewed."
"There is to-day<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> nothing more than
traditions to feed upon.... The world of humanity
is in the dark." One chapter in Thornton
Chase's "The Bahai Revelation" is headed "The
Bahai Revelation is needed." This he argues,
stating (1) that Christianity is condemned because after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>1900 years it has not been accepted by all people;
(2) because it refuses to reject miracles and the blood
atonement and will not confine itself to the "principles
of Jesus," as the Brahma Samaj; (3) because it
tends to separate peoples, holding itself to be the only
religion authorized by God; (4) because people are
dwelling in bondage and are no <b>longer</b> satisfied.
Tares are many and Baha Ullah must come and
uproot them.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>"The old order of things is passing away," says
Sprague;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> "people are being tossed about with
every wind of doctrine." "True religion is forgotten,"
says Phelps,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> "or has become a hollow
name; faith has waned, men are wandering in the
dark." This decay, they teach, is inevitable and in
accord with divine arrangement. They deny the
belief of Christians that Christianity is the permanent
religion of humanity; and that of Moslems, that Mohammed
was the "seal of the prophets," and hold
that Christianity was succeeded by Islam, Islam by
Babism, and Babism by Bahaism. Abdul Baha says:
"Time changes all things. Transmutation and
change are requirements of life. All religions of
God are subject to the same law. They are founded
in order to blossom out and develop and fulfill their
mission. They reach their zenith and then decline
and come to an end." "A new cycle must begin,
for the world needs a new luminary."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary to refute the fundamental fallacy
of this first claim, for it is patent that Christianity is
alive and growing. Its manifold spiritual activities,
its varied and progressive efforts for righteousness
and peace among men, for social and moral reforms,
its zeal for Missions and their marvellous success,
show that Christianity is neither stagnant nor dead.
It has a forward triumphant movement. The Church
renews its strength from its divine Head; He, alive
forevermore, is its Light and its Life.</p>

<p>II. Bahaism claims to be the divine Revelation
in this new cycle&mdash;a new Dispensation or Covenant.
It disclaims being a new religion, affirming rather
that it is a renewal of religion or religion renewed.
One writes: "The Revelation is not a new religion,
but the very essence of God's word as taught by
Christ (and Moses and Mohammed), but not perceived
by Christians at large" (nor by Jews nor Mohammedans).
Baha Ullah<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> says: "Of the utterances
of the prophets of the past we have taken the
essence, and in the garment of brevity clothed it."
Abdul Baha says: "The same basis, which was laid
by Christ and later on forgotten, has been renewed
by Baha Ullah." "All that is true in all religions
will stand; by the new Dispensation, new spirit is
infused into these teachings."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Phelps<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> says: "The
body of doctrine which Bahaism teaches is not put
forward in any sense or particular as new, but as a
unification and synthesis of all other religions." Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
its system of morals the same is true. It is a restatement
in unsystematic form of common ethics.
It reiterates the second table of the Mosaic Law, and
the New Testament principles of brotherly love and
unity. Yet in some of his addresses Abdul Baha
names certain principles as new in the Bahai faith,
such as universal peace, the unity of humanity, arbitration,
compulsory education of both sexes, the
harmony of science and religion, the evil of prejudice
and fanaticism, need of investigating the truth,
etc. Not one of these is new; not one owes its position
in the world of thought or activity to the Bahai
propaganda.</p>

<p>But whether Bahaism claims to be new in its principles
or disclaims it, in fact it is a new religion.
The disavowals are, no doubt, made for the sake of
obtaining easier access to the followers of the old religions,
and are only a temporary expediency. In
this they are simply following the example of Mohammed,
who proclaimed his message to the people
of Arabia as the religion of Abraham, and as the
same as that of the Law and the Gospels. But it is
evident that Bahaism is inconsistent with Christianity,
as indeed with Islam. Bahais' claims, if admitted,
would lead to the superseding of Christianity.
This will appear when I state its doctrines. The
present attitude of Bahais in maintaining connection
with Christian Churches and at the same time worshipping
Baha and propagating Bahaism is one of
intellectual stultification or of moral blindness.</p>

<p>In the same way, in Moslem lands, Bahais con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>form to the externals of Islam. In the case of the
latter the cause of this is often moral obliquity or
fear; with deceived Christian brethren it is probably
ignorance; by the Bahai propagandist it is allowed
from astute policy. It is an intellectual impossibility
for one to accept the teachings of Baha Ullah and to
be his disciple and at the same time to be an intelligent
disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one excludes
the other. Bahaism is a distinct religion. It
is not even a sect of Islam. It abrogates and annuls
it. Professor Browne says: "As Christianity is a
different religion from Judaism, and as Islam is distinct
from Christianity, so Bahaism is a separate religion,
distinct from Christianity or Islam." It even
superseded and abrogated Babism. The Bab has
been relegated to the background, and put into the
position of a John the Baptist. His book, the
"Bayan," is long ago neglected to such an extent
that Professor Browne had difficulty in obtaining
a copy in Persia. Remey<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> says: "Babism fulfilled
its purpose, and when this was accomplished in the
appearance of Baha Ullah, it, as such, ceased to exist."
Mirza Abul Fazl<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> says: Babism "is not the
same religion or creed as Bahaism."</p>

<p>A statement of the fundamental doctrines of
Bahaism will suffice to show that it is a distinct religion.</p>

<p>(1) The fundamental assertion of Bahaism is that
Baha Ullah is the Manifestation or Incarnation of
God the Father. Baha Ullah says of himself in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
letter to the Pope: "O Pope! This is indeed the
Father of whom Isaiah gave you tidings and the
Comforter whom Christ promised." Abdul Baha
affirms: "The Father, foretold by Christ, has come
amongst us." "The Father of Christ is come among
you."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> "The manifested God Himself has come."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
He is called the "Lord of Hosts," "the Lord God
Almighty," "Creator of whomsoever is in the
world," also "the Ruler." Abdul Baha cabled back
to America after his voyage: "Thanks to Baha
Ullah, we arrived safely at Liverpool."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Instead of
beginning a book, as the Moslems do, "In the name
of God," the Bahais begin, "In the Name of our
Lord El Baha."</p>

<p>The Persian Bahais accept this teaching. One of
them in Tabriz declared to me: "Baha is very God
of very God." M. Abdul Karim delivered the doctrine
in this form to the disciples in America<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and
said: "Upon the Day, when God Almighty, in the
form of man known as Baha Ullah declared Himself
and said, 'I am God and there is no God but
Me,' the old heavens and old earth passed away,
all things became new." So it continues to be
preached.</p>

<p>Mr. Remey<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> says in the Bahai monthly (the capitals
are his): "This one is <span class="smcap">The Father</span> Himself,
The Manifested <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>Himself</i> <span class="smcap">Bahaullah</span>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>(2) The Revelation of Baha is contained in his
Books and Tablets (Epistles). Some of these are
the "Ikan," the "Surat ul-Haykal," the "Hidden
Words," the "Seven Valleys," and the "Kitab-ul-Akdas."
Remey<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> pronounces them "The latest
and greatest of God's revelations to the world."
"They contain knowledge which was sealed and
closed up by the prophets of bygone cycles, so that
the minds of the wisest of men were unable to comprehend
it." Thornton Chase, exceeding the others
in his extravagant language, declares that "were all
the books of former days lost and forgotten, the
whole of true religious teaching could be found in
the 'Bahai Revelation.'"</p>

<p>The "Kitab-ul-Akdas," "The Most Holy Book,"
is called by M. Abul Fazl the "greatest" and "most
important." It consists of 146 pages of manuscript,
about 10,000 words. It was written at Acca in Persian
and Arabic. It has been translated into Russian,
and a synopsis of it is given by Professor
Browne,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> of Cambridge University, in the <i>Journal
of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, 1892, of which I make
use. The "Kitab-ul-Akdas" warns the learned
against criticizing it, and in imitation of Mohammed
challenges them to produce the like of it. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
similar in its teachings to the "Bayan" of the Bab,
though less fantastic and mystical. Its contents are
confused and unsystematic. It has laws&mdash;ceremonial,
moral, civil, criminal&mdash;mingled with rhapsodies,
exhortations, addresses, and various digressions.
After an introduction and some laws, follow
addresses to the Emperor of Germany and to the
Sultan of Turkey, to the cities of Teheran and
Kirman, and to the province of Khorasan. After
more laws there is a digression about revelation;
then more laws and a digression about the Bab;
again sundry laws, followed by a denunciation
of Subh-i-Azal, and this by various civil laws,
ending with a command to select a universal language.</p>

<p>The book is a medley, and bears internal evidence
of the truth of the tradition that it was written piecemeal
in answer to various questions from believers.
The fragments were jumbled together without order.
The learned are reminded by Baha that he never
studied the sciences, and there is too abundant evidence
in the book itself to confirm the statement.
It ranks far below Deuteronomy as a system of laws
or a literary composition.</p>

<p>The opening words of the Book of Akdas state the
conditions of entrance into the religion of Baha:
(1) "Verily the first thing which God hath ordained
unto His servants is the knowledge of the Dawning-Place
of the Revelation [<i>i. e.</i>, of Baha]. Whosoever
hath attained thereunto hath attained unto all good;
and he who is deprived thereof is indeed of the peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>ple of error&mdash;even though he bringeth all good
actions." (2) "It behoveth every one to follow that
whereunto he is commanded. These two things are
inseparable." Acceptance of Baha as the Manifestation
of God and following Him in obedience are
the two conditions of discipleship. (3) A third condition
has been added since the death of Baha&mdash;namely,
adherence to Abdul Baha Abbas as supreme
Head, "the centre of the covenant." This assumption
of authority by Abbas caused a bitter and angry
schism at Acca.</p>

<p>Remey<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> says: "He [Baha] has pointed to the one
who should be looked upon as authority by all, and
has closed the doors to outside interpretation.
Therefore obedience and submission must be shown
completely to him." Mirza Asad Ullah<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> says:
"Whosoever turns away from Abdul Baha is one of
the companions of the left hand [a goat], and one of
the letters of hell-fire." The rejectors of Abdul Baha
are termed Nakazeen&mdash;"the violators." They are
"cut off," are "no longer of the Kingdom." They
are "spiritual corpses," from them "goes forth a
poisonous infection," "they have a vile odour,"
says Abdul Baha,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> the preacher of brotherly love
and unity. In this way they fulfill their boast of
consorting with all men in "harmony and fragrance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p><p>The minority seem to have the best of the argument,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
but Abbas has established himself as Supreme
Pontiff. His most honoured agents call him by titles
which imply his divinity. American pilgrims worship
him as "Christ, the Master."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Sprague<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> declares
him to be "the third of the great Trinity of
Revelators." M. Abul Karim<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> writes: "God appeared
in the Bab as the Holy Ghost, in Baha as the
Father, in Abbas as His Son." Mrs. Grundy<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> says:
"Within Abdul Baha is the inexhaustible fountain of
knowledge." Remey<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> says: "Through Abdul Baha
and through him only can believers receive the
spiritual power and sustenance necessary for their
growth." Among Abbas's titles are the "Greatest
Branch of God," the "Mystery of God."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>These are a few of the salient points of the "new
revelation."</p>

<p>III. Another claim of Bahaism is that of superiority
to former religions.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Its founder is declared to be superior in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
personality, in his divine knowledge, in his power of
revealing. In what has already been quoted, this is
evident. The great cycle which began in Adam is
said to have reached its culmination in Baha Ullah.
"The Manifestations are ended by the appearance
of this, which is the greatest of all Manifestations,"
which "manifests itself only once in 500,000 years."
"He is exalted above all those who are upon earth
and in the heaven." Abdul Baha<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> says: "Consider
the time of Jesus. This is greater than that for as
much as it is the calling of the Lord of Hosts."
"All the great prophets were perfect mirrors of God&mdash;manifestations
of the 'Primal Will' of God&mdash;and
sinless, but in Baha<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> in some sense the Divine Essence
is manifested." Phelps<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> says: "He is greater
than his predecessors." "Baha," says Kheiralla,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
"is the Everlasting Father, who spoke in Abraham,
Moses, and Jesus Christ, who were His ministers,
and at these latter days He came Himself in the flesh
to judge the quick and the dead." Abbas said to
Mrs. Grundy: "Baha is the consummation of all degrees.
He is the Revelation of all truth and light."
"Christ is the vine, Baha is the husbandman&mdash;the
Lord of the vineyard." A poem says of Baha:</p>

<p class="in1">
By His life-fostering lip live a hundred such as Jesus;<br />
By the Sinai of His aspect sit a thousand such as Moses;<br />
Thou, on the night of ascent, didst entertain the prophet as Thy guest.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p class="noin">Refrain:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Temple of God's glory is none other than Baha;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If one seeks God, let him seek Him in Baha.</span><br />
Thou art the King of the Realm of the everlasting,<br />
Thou art the Manifestation of the essence of the Lord of Glory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">The Creator of Creation.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Such are some of the "great swelling words"
with which his followers exalt Baha. Yet when we
examine his life we find nothing to justify such extravagance.
He was simply a man of like passions
as others. It may seem invidious to refer to
scandalous stories of Baha's youth in Teheran.
But does not truth demand that it be stated that his
reputation in Persia is sullied by definite accusations
of vice and immorality? I have heard such narratives
with statements of the time, place, and associates
who were partakers of his guilt. His family
in riper years exhibits no higher example than a
bigamous household. According to the narrative of
Abdul Baha in the "Traveller's Narrative,"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> he
planned in duplicity to reach the headship of the
Babis; for while purposing all the while to set forth
a claim for himself, he put forward his half-brother,
Subh-i-Azal, as the successor of the Bab&mdash;to protect
himself and to insure his own safety during times of
danger. He outwardly supported Azal for many
years, while secretly planning to supplant him.
While acting as Azal's trusted minister, he was
drawing the people to himself. We pass over the
attempts of these brothers to poison each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Each accuses<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> the other, and, as the Persians say,
"God knows" whether both speak the truth. We
pass over, at present, the definite accusations against
the Bahais of assassinating the Azalis.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> In the
notorious case where Azalis were foully murdered<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
by Bahais at Acca, and the latter were brought to
trial before the Turkish authorities, they were defended
and kept in favour by Baha. He had near
Subh-i-Azal a spy named Maskin Kalam,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> who by
guile and deceit kept away any who wished to visit
Azal. He received this disciple to his intimate circle
after years of such active deception. Azal, who is
called by Bahais "the point of Satan," and is likened
to Cain and Judas, has a character gentler, more lovable,
and more sincere than Baha as the two are depicted
in the writings of Professor Browne; albeit,
Baha is abler, more astute, more a leader of men.
Professor Browne, in his interviews at Famagusta
and at Acca, did obeisance to each of them. His
bow to Azal may have been one of respect for his
character or disposition; his bow to Baha must
rather have been out of regard for his influence and
leadership. But after all we need not wonder so
much at the delusion of the Bahais in exalting Baha,
for we are familiar with Dowie and Zion City, and with
Joseph Smith and the Mormons. And we are surely
led to expect the appearance of such a deceiver who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
"as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself
that he is God." Bahais certainly, in the words
of the Apostle,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> "have strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie."</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Bahais claim superiority for the books
and writings of Baha Ullah.</p>

<p>(1) As to the rapidity of their composition, their
style, and their quantity. One of the proofs of the
Bab was the rapidity with which he composed verses,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
"with amazing rapidity, without any reflection."
Sayid Yahya of Darab, one of his first converts,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> was
gained by such a "sign," implying, as was supposed,
divine inspiration. He propounded certain questions.
The messenger brought the answer, of which
he says: "I beheld a marvel a hundred thousandfold
beyond what I sought for. Over two thousand
verses and illustrations of eloquence and beauty of
style revealed and written down during five or six
hours." So also in Ispahan, in answer to the Imam-Juma<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>:
"The Bab began to write, and in three hours
wrote 1,000 verses. Then the Imam-Juma was convinced
that such power was from God, being beyond
the capacity of man." In his trial at Tabriz<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> the
Bab cited as a proof of his divine mission: "I can
write in one day 2,000 verses. Who else can do
this?"</p>

<p>In like manner the claim was made for Baha Ullah
that he could compose with miraculous rapidity.
"The maximum speed of Baha's revelation is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
be 1,500 verses in one hour." These were "written
without premeditation or reflection,"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and often dictated
to his amanuensis. To Baha is attributed the
marvellous feat of composing and writing the "Ikan"
in a single night. This book in its English translation
consists of 184 printed pages. The translator,
Mirza Ali Kuli Khan, Persian Charg&eacute; des Affaires at
Washington, a zealous Bahai, says in his preface:<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
"According to the prevailing opinion of Bahais, the
'Ikan' was written in one night by the supreme
pen." He argues (faint-heartedly apparently) for
the truth of the statement, and cites Abul Fazl as corroborating
the tradition. It is altogether probable
that Baha prepared the "Ikan" during his retirement
for two years to Kurdistan, in the region of
Suleimaniyeh. It is curious to note how the Bahais
have outdone Mohammed. He made his verses
(ayat = signs), and their eloquence and beauty the
signs of his mission. But Babis and Bahais add rapidity
of composition as an additional sign or miracle.</p>

<p>The quantity of the writings is also emphasized as
proving their divine source and power. It was a
matter of boasting that the Bab's writings were from
100,000 to 500,000 verses, and he was executed at
twenty-five years of age. Of Baha's Abdul Baha
says: "The Books of his Holiness number more than
100; each one sufficient for mankind." Abul Fazl<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
writes: "His Holy Tablets exceed in quantity the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Heavenly Books and Divine Writings possessed by
all the different nations of the earth." The number
of these tablets is stated to be over 1,000. By way
of contrast, Christ's teachings are said by Abdul
Baha to consist of only a dozen pages scattered in
the Gospels.</p>

<p>When they speak of the style, the eloquence, the
enlightening power of Baha's writings, it is with
similar superlative adjectives of high-flown Persian
rhetoric.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact
that this so-called proof is simply a matter of assertion
and opinion. As to rapidity, we could wish
Baha had taken more time and made such books as
the "Kitab-ul-Akdas" more systematic, for, as we
have pointed out, it is sadly lacking in plan. The
veriest tyro could improve on it by rewriting.</p>

<p>If quantity were an argument, the product of
Baha's pen has been exceeded by many Christian
and Moslem divines. Besides, what advantage is it
for a religion to be set forth in 100 volumes? Will
God be heard for His much speaking any more than
man would be? The story of redemption and God's
revelation through 4,000 years makes but one goodly
volume.</p>

<p>As to style, the Persians would scorn to have the
beauty of their great poets or of such writings as the
"Masnavi" put into comparison with the "Ikan" or
"Akdas." The Bab's writings were not even grammatical.
Baha's are more intelligible than the Bab's,
but lack his originality and depth. Baha's style is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rhetorical, verbose, prolix, but with a certain strength.
But Mirza Abul Fazl holds a more forceful and sagacious
pen. In some things Baha's writings remind
one of the Church Fathers in contrast to the Gospel
narratives. The quantity of his writings, his system
of quotations from former Holy Books, his allegorical
interpretations, recall Iren&aelig;us or Origen.</p>

<p>As to "verses" in general, and their rhetorical
quality as a proof of divine inspiration and revelation,
it would be well for Bahais to remember that
the Bab recognized divine quality in the verses of
Subh-i-Azal, which the Bahais reject with disdain.
When the "verses" of Azal came to the Bab, he
"rejoiced exceedingly,"<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> nominated him as his successor,
and left to him the completion of the "Bayan."
Was he mistaken in so important a matter? However
that may be, the Bahais contradict him and pronounce
the "verses" of Azal good for nothing.
M. Ahmad Zohrab,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> the interpreter of Abdul Baha,
avers that "the writings of Azal are most childish.
They are jumbled, confused, meaningless composition."
Another Bahai, Nabil the poet, at one time
wrote "revealed verses," and Azal approved of them
and sealed their inspiration. Afterwards Nabil repudiated
his own "divinity." Evidently, then, the
"proof from verses" is a very uncertain and unreliable
one.</p>

<p>(2) They claim superiority for the contents of the
Revelation. In describing the substance and variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of it, their "great swelling words" know no bounds.
Abdul Baha says: "They are universal, covering
every subject. He has revealed scientific explanations
ranging throughout all the realms of human
inquiry&mdash;astronomy, biology, medicine, etc. He
wrote lengthy tablets upon civilization, sociology, and
government." "One book of the Blessed Perfection
is more comprehensive than fifty volumes of the
world's greatest wisdom." Empty boasting!</p>

<p>Professor Browne<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> says: "The countless tablets
are for the most part rhapsodies interspersed with
ethical maxims." Let us give a few of Baha's "revelations"
on morals, philosophy, and science. His
ethics permit bigamy and <i>tagiya</i>, dissimulation regarding
one's faith; his Law punishes habitual theft
by branding, and arson by burning, and compounds
adultery with a small fine; his philosophy affirms
the eternity of matter and the emanation theory of divine
Manifestations; his science decides the purity of
water by three points&mdash;"colour, taste, and smell"&mdash;but
knows nothing of analysis, and affirms that "the
food of the future will be fruits and grains"; it
abolished the weeks and months and substitutes nineteen
months of nineteen days each, and a system of
nineteen units for the decimal or metric system; it
creates a new alphabet to bother childhood; its
ritual for prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage somewhat
resembles the Moslem, with times and places
changed. These are samples of its new and superior
(?) laws and precepts, which are mingled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
mass of ordinary moral teaching. There is far too
much of it for a religious system, but it is entirely
inadequate as a judicial and criminal code. Abul
Fazl<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> grossly exaggerates when he writes that
"Baha has enacted laws and regulations concerning
every point or subject."</p>

<p>As a system Bahaism is not superlative. "It is,"
says Professor Browne,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> "at most a new synthesis of
old ideas; ideas with which the Eastern mind has
for centuries been familiar, and which have ere now
been more clearly and more logically systematized
by older schools of thought, though perhaps they
were without a certain tincture of modern Western
terminology which is perceptible in Bahaism." "Of
the doctrines of the Bab"&mdash;and the same is true of
Bahaism&mdash;"taken separately, there was hardly one
of which he could claim to be the author, and not
many which did not remount to a remote antiquity."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
"The theories of symbolism,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> incarnation, and other
doctrines differ in no essential particular from those
held by the Ismielis." If desirable, the doctrines
and laws could be traced severally, as has been done
by Doctor Tisdall in his "Yanab-ul-Islam" regarding
the Koran, and the source of each shown. Borrowing
so much from the Shiah sects, its fundamental
basis in philosophic thought is inferior even to Islam.
But because it borrows so much from the enlightened
principles and practices of advanced Christian
peoples, its moral system is an advance on Islam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Christianity may boldly assert its unique superiority
to this "half-cooked" system, to use a Persian idiom.
Professor Browne<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> vetoes its claim to superiority,
saying: "I do not admit that the Bahai or any
other religion can supply a rule of life higher than
that which Christ has given us." Discussing with
the Bahais in Shiraz,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> he said: "The religion of Mohammed
was certainly not a higher development of
the religion of Christ. It is impossible for any one
who has understood the teachings of Christ to prefer
the teachings of Mohammed. As you say each
Manifestation must be fuller, completer, and more
perfect than the last, you must prove that the doctrines
taught by Baha are superior to those of Christ&mdash;a
thing that I confess seems to be almost impossible,
for I cannot imagine a doctrine purer and
more elevated than that of Christ."</p>

<p>IV. Bahaism claims to be the Universal Religion.
Dreyfus called his book on Bahaism "The Universal
Religion." Remey<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> says: "The Universal Religion
is what the Bahai movement offers to the world."
Phelps<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> says: "It is divinely inspired world-religion
in its first youth. Baha Ullah is a world-teacher in
a broader sense than they"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the founders of
other religions. This claim is not only that it is intended
"for all people, under all conditions," and is
adapted to all, but that it is so all-inclusive and
latitudinarian that it can<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> "unite all those now
following many systems into one universal faith," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>that "each religious sect<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> will hear in the words of
Baha its own oft-repeated message, which has been
dulled and distorted."</p>

<p>The latter phase of this claim we may dismiss in a
word. It is simply a gloss. It is an imagination of
enthusiastic Bahais. Neither Christians, Moslems,
nor others will be thus included, except some few
before they understand Bahaism. The only inclusion
it offers is by accepting the divine character
and mission of Baha and Abbas;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> in other words,
by becoming Bahais. When they address the
Hindu, saying, "We are one with you," "We teach
the original Hinduism of your fathers," it is simply
to add: "Baha is the fulfillment of your books, follow
him." When they allow the Jewish Bahai of
Hamadan still to consort with the Jews as a Jew,
and to be baptized and pass as a Christian at the
same time, it is an inclusiveness which is unjustifiable
and deceitful. It is teaching <i>tagiya</i> or religious
dissimulation to other races after the manner
of the Persian Shiahs. It is, at most, merely a temporary
subterfuge.</p>

<p>Let such double-faced Bahais read Remey's article
in the <i>Star of the West</i>,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> entitled "Let the New follow
the New," and they will see how untenable is
their position. He says: "The Bahai Cause is not
merely one of many phases of universal truth (as
some say), but is the only living truth to-day; the
only source of divine knowledge to mankind. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
revelation of Jesus was for His own dispensation&mdash;that
of 'the Son.' Now it is no longer the point of
guidance to the world. We are in total darkness if
we are refusing the revelation of the present dispensation.
Bahais must be severed from all and everything
that is past&mdash;things both good and bad&mdash;everything.
Now all is changed. All the teachings
of the past are past. Abdul Baha is now supplying
all the world." We read this, with amazement
at such pretensions, such groundless assumptions,
yet are pleased with the ring of sincerity.
We, too, say, "Let a Bahai stand for Bahaism."
Even so, let a Christian stand for Christianity, and
not stultify his intellect by professing to hold to both
religions. But such teachings as Remey's absolutely
negative the claim of Bahaism to be able to include
the professors of all religions. In conclusion,
Bahaism aims at being universal just as every other
"ism," even as Mormonism, by persuading the
world to forsake its old faiths and adopt its new
dogmas. Baha<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> states in a tablet: "Blessed is the
brave one, who, with a firm step, walks out of the
corridors of intimacy [the old religious restrictions]
and takes a place in the ranks."</p>

<p>Is Bahaism fitted to be a universal religion? It
has copied much from Christianity and Islam; it
would not be strange if it has caught something of
the same impetus towards universality. This is
specially to be looked for in Bahaism, since it is historically
a revision of Babism&mdash;revised with an aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to broadening it. Babism was notoriously unfitted
to be universal. Dreyfus<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> confesses: "Looking at
the Bab's work, we cannot fail to notice in it a certain
sectarian particularism which would have confined
to Shiah Islam its benefits." Similarly Professor
Browne pronounced it<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> "utterly unfitted for the
bulk of mankind," and refers to<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> "the useless, impractical,
and irksome regulations and restrictions"
which Baha abolished in order to make it more
capable of becoming what he intended it to be&mdash;"a
universal system suitable to all mankind." The
question arises, Where was the Bab's power of
supernatural revelation if he promulgated a system
and regulations of such inferiority and destined to
be superseded in less than a score of years? Among
these regulations<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> were the prohibition of the learning
of foreign languages, logic, philosophy, and
jurisprudence, discouraging foreign travel, enjoining
the expulsion of all unbelievers from the five
chief provinces of Persia, together with the confiscation
of their property, the destruction of all books
more than 202 years old, etc.</p>

<p>Baha, like a tailor trying to change a misfitting
garment, ripped up the seams, cut a piece out here
and there, added some patches imported from Christian
civilization, until he had a coat of many colours,
which he advertised as the latest style of religion,
fitted to humanity in general. But he should have
heeded the precept not to put new cloth on an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
garment. No wonder they have never yet published
the "Kitab-ul-Akdas" in English. It would tax their
ingenuity to adapt all its regulations and laws to the
world-life.</p>

<p>Again I return to the question, "Is Bahaism
specially adapted to be universal?" By no means.
It is unfitted in the most essential particular. It is a
religion of laws, not of principles. Mirza Abul Fazl,
in "The Brilliant Proof,"<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> emphasizes the fact that
Bahaism enjoins, commands, has imperative ordinances,
laws, and enactments. But the Gospels
enunciate principles. These principles of the New
Testament are conscience-educating and life-directing.
They are applicable to all conditions the world
over, and to every stage of human development.
Christianity implants in the heart great ruling
motives. Its laws and regulations are few. Hence
it does not find itself butting against a wall of unforeseen
circumstances. Bahaism, on the contrary, is
full of the "beggarly elements." It has regulations,
as we have noticed, in regard to personal habits,
hygiene, sociology, languages, the calendar, civil
government, penology, etc. It is like an omnibus
with its top overloaded with all sorts of baggage,
which will delay and finally wreck the vehicle. It
has made itself a "judge and divider of inheritances."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
It gives directions as to the barber and
the undertaker; how you must bathe and wash your
face, and what prayers you shall say during each
process. It directs as to the use of knives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
forks, of chairs, of perfumes. It graciously permits
one to shave his beard, but "the hair must not be
allowed to grow below the level of the ear." It tells
us that "the nails are to be cut at least once a week,"
that "every one should wash his feet daily in
summer, and at least every three days in winter."
And alas! for antique furniture and old Persian
rugs! For house furnishings must be changed
every nineteen years. In obedience to this command
my old teacher in Persia got rid of his rugs,
whose sheen was polished and colours were mellowed
with age, and refurnished his house with gaudy
modern rugs. In prescribing the Moslem fast and
namaz (prayer-rite), with some modifications, Bahaism
limits the spirit of liberty, which is the essence
of universality.</p>

<p>Copying from the Bab, Baha has seen fit to
regulate the calendar. Following the Zoroastrian
custom, Baha ordains that the year begin at the
vernal equinox&mdash;March 21&mdash;because that is the
spring-time, the time of the renewal of vegetable
life. Good! But in Australia it is the time of
death&mdash;of the approach of winter. The reason
assigned is not universal, and is not adapted to all
climes. As has been said above, the months are
ordained to be nineteen of nineteen days each, with
four or five intercalary days in March. The week
is abolished, that primitive division of time which
has such a definite place in nature, in the phases of
the moon, and is established in the three great
monotheistic religions with their weekly Sabbaths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Instead of the latter is substituted the nineteenth
day Unity feast. How do such changes aid universality
or unification? Coinage, fines, taxes, and
tithes are arranged on the number 19. Remey's
book has nineteen chapters, as the "Bayan" has.
<i>The Star of the West</i>, a magazine of the American
Bahais, is published every nineteen days, and bears
the Bahai calendar on its editorial page. Instances
might be indefinitely extended. But later the
number nine, the number of Baha, has come more
into use. Abbas has set apart the ninth day of the
month as well as the nineteenth for certain religious
purposes. The Bahai era is sometimes dated from
the declaration of the Bab in 1844, and sometimes
from the birth of Baha in 1817. Are these innovations
more an aid to universality than adherence to
the established calendar and era, or than the decimal
system or the metric system which the civilized
world has been striving to extend? Professor
Browne says: "What could be more impractical
than the adoption of the number nineteen as the
basis of measures or calculations?" It bears the
mark of Oriental fancy rather than of divine
revelation.</p>

<p>Another illustration of this point&mdash;namely, that
Bahaism enjoins and regulates specifically, and
does not, like Christianity, inculcate guiding principles,
is seen in the law regarding civil government.
In "Glad Tidings"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Baha teaches, as from God, that
"although a republican form of government profits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of
God. We do not wish that the countries of the
world should be deprived thereof." "Statesmen
should combine the two," and<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> "At present the
form of government followed by the British nation
seems good, for that nation is illuminated both with
the light of kingship and consultation&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, parliament."
"In the principal Laws [of Bahaism] affairs
have been placed in the hands of just kings and
chiefs, and the House of Justice." As a matter of
opinion, I can join with Baha in expressing my admiration
for the British Constitution, but prescribing
it as a law of revelation is a different matter. A
"universal religion" should be adapted to all conditions.
It is a fact of history that when the tablet
"Glad Tidings" was sent to Russia, section 15 was
omitted. The Bahais suppressed this portion from
expediency, and it appears thus mutilated in Baron
Rosen's translation.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Is not this a high-handed way
to deal with God's Word, as they profess to regard
it? Is it not also conceivable that republics might
take offense against Bahaism because it maintains
monarchy, even as autocracies because it approves
of parliamentary government? Had not a "universal
religion" better let politics alone? Christianity
could adapt itself even to the government of
a Nero.</p>

<p>Another institution of Bahaism, ill-adapted to all
races and conditions, and certain to bring the very
conflict and strife against which it is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
guard, is the House of Justice. This is a religious
court, with civil and political functions, to be set up
in every town and country. It is to be composed of
nine or more Bahai men. "They are divine agents,
representatives of God." Much is said of this House
of Justice in the Books of Revelation.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Dreyfus devotes
a chapter to it.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> It is to have legislative,
judicial, and administrative functions. It will regulate
estates, taxes, tithes, fines, capital and labour,
marriage, divorce, inheritances, minors, servants,
charities, reforms, houses of correction, schools, besides
all matters of religion and morals. They will
rule "absolutely," and be "infallible," "guided by
God." It is the old dream of theocratic rule. I
must leave it to the imagination of the student of
history to picture the dire confusion which would
ensue if this politico-religious hierarchy should begin
its sway. Those who are familiar with the perpetual
conflict between the urfi and the shari, the civil and
the religious law in Persia, know how this proposed
organization would work confusion worse confounded.</p>

<p>Similar to these invasions of the province of science
and C&aelig;sar is the attempt to improve philology by
"revelation." Following the Bab again, Baha Ullah
promulgated a new alphabet. The Babi alphabet,
unlike the Arabic and Persian, was written from left
to right. "Each letter consists of thick, oblique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
straight lines, parallel and equidistant from each
other, running down to the left, to which thin hooks
and curves are appended to make separate letters."
It is called the Khatti-Badi. There were nineteen
kinds of it; one kind was called the Khatti-Baha.
It was intended for the time when Babism would be
prevalent. It appears that Bahais have a new alphabet,
different from that of the Babis.</p>

<p>In the Akdas and in the sixth Ishrak<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> it is commanded
that the "House of Justice" must select one
tongue out of the present languages, or a new language,
to teach the children in the schools of the
world. Let us suppose they decide on Persian or
Arabic. The Anglo-Saxon children must all begin
to learn Arabic. Suppose they decide on English.
Then Germans, French, and Russians will have an
additional reason for opposing the religion. Suppose
that Abdul Baha decides on Esperanto, as he
seems inclined to do, then will it be heresy for some
one to invent a language as much superior to Esperanto
as it is to Volapuk? Had not a "universal
religion" better let linguistics alone? The spirit of
Christianity gives a free field to all tongues&mdash;this is
the essence of liberty, of universality. After this
brief review of some of the provisions of the "New
Revelation," we can deny the claim that "its statutes
meet the necessity of every land," and that they can
serve the world well for 1,000 years.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="h2">Its Specific Claims</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Bahaism is a Persian delusion, whose headman Baha Ullah in
Acre claimed to be an incarnation of God. Abbas Effendi succeeded
him and is running the "incarnation" fraud for all it is
worth, and it is worth a good deal, as pilgrims constantly come
from Persia and bring their offerings in money with great liberality.
Such men ... as the Babites of Persia turn up now and then
in the East, "go up like a rocket and down like a stick."&mdash;<i>H. H.
Jessup, "Fifty-three Tears in Syria," p. 637.</i></p>

<p>I cannot understand how a Christian can possibly exchange the
clear consistent plan of salvation through Christ for the misty and
mystical platitudes of Bahaism.&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 687.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">BAHAISM makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> various claims of a practical
nature. Some of these will require detailed
treatment. Several of them I will group in
this chapter. Additional light is thrown on the
question of their validity by facts subsequently
brought forward, for many facts have a bearing on
several subjects.</p>

<p>Among the specific claims put forth by Bahaism is
that of being <i>specially adapted to promote the unification
of mankind</i>, and of accomplishing that end.
Bahaism reiterates the Christian ideas that God
hath made of one blood all nations and that all shall
be united in God's spiritual kingdom. It repeats as
a slogan, "the brotherhood of man." C. M. Remey<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
says: "The Bahai cause stands for the unity of all
religions, political unity of nations, the social unity
of all classes, peoples and races." "Its aim," says
Harold Johnson, "is to knit all the faiths and all the
peoples into one."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> "The essential principle of the
teachings of Bahaism is the unification of the religious
systems of the world," says MacNutt.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> This is a
high ideal, which interpreted in their several ways is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the aim of Christianity, Islam, Socialism, etc. And
Bahai writers mean what all the other systems have
meant, namely, unity by all accepting their beliefs,
for Remey<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> says: "Baha Ullah's mission is to unite
those now following many systems into one brotherhood
and one universal faith.... May God
speed the day when all of us may become true
<i>Bahais</i>."</p>

<p>But the claim of Bahaism is presented in another
form. It asserts that it is actually bringing about
this unification. "Abdul Baha is harmonizing Christians,
Jews, Mohammedans, Zoroastrians, Buddhists,
Hindus in the one and true faith."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Dreyfus says:
"It is uniting all men in the great universal religion
of the future." At Oakland, Cal.,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Abdul Baha said,
"The revelation of Baha Ullah is the cause of the
oneness of the world of humanity. It is a unity
which welds together all the races." In illustration
of this alleged result, the pilgrims to Acca express
their gratification and amazement that at Acca several
races meet together in love and unity. So in
Rangoon, says Mr. Sprague,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> "I attended a Bahai
meeting at which six of the great world religions
were represented united in the wonderful bond of
friendship and unity." In like manner Mr. Harold
Johnson says, "What Christianity has failed to accomplish,
Bahaism has accomplished in uniting men
of different races and religions." If these assertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
mean external association, it may be said that Christians
have had their Parliaments of Religions and
Congresses of all faiths, examples of polite toleration
and laboratories of the science of religion. If it means
that Christianity refuses to put itself on a level with
other religions and consort with them as equals, this
is true, for Christianity is an exclusive religion. It
has entered the world, as it entered the Roman empire,
to displace all others. It refuses to have Christ
occupy a niche in the Pantheon. But Bahai writers
mean rather that Bahaism is to be the bond of unity
by all races and religions accepting Baha. In this
sense their claim is based on very meagre premises.
A few thousand only, outside of Persia, have embraced
Bahaism. Harold Johnson says: "The Non-Mohammedans
do not number probably very many
thousands." But do we not see myriads gathering
into the Christian brotherhood out of every race and
religion of Asia, including even thousands from
Islam. Thirty thousand Moslems have become
Christians in Malayasia in Abdul Baha's lifetime.
In Asia how many races and religions, forgetting
their former antagonisms, are united in the faith
and baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ. As an example
of the living power of the Christian faith to
unite the races of men, take the Conference of the
International Christian Students' Federation, held at
Lake Mohonk, N. Y. There Hindus and British,
Japanese and Koreans, Russians and Chinese,
Greeks and Armenians, French and Germans,
Canadians and Brazilians, Americans and Mexicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
represented the wide world. Mutual esteem, love
and spiritual fellowship united members of the
various Protestant Churches with representatives
of the Oriental Churches. The unity in Bahai Assemblies
is on so small a scale as to be not worthy
of mention. How little Abdul Baha knows of or
appreciates the reality and power of Christian
spiritual fellowship is shown in his remarks at
West Englewood, N. Y.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> "This gathering (of
Bahais) has no peer or likeness upon the surface
of the earth, for all other gatherings and assemblages
are due to some physical basis or material
interests. Bahai meetings are mirrors of the kingdom."
When Abdul Baha speaks about the results
of Bahaism in bringing about unification in Persia,
his claims seem utterly extravagant. To one who
knows that country from long residence they are
explicable only on the supposition that he has been
misinformed or deceived by his own followers, for it
must be borne in mind that Abdul Baha left Persia
when a child of six or eight and has never returned.
Hear these words which Abdul Baha addressed to
Rev. J. T. Bixley, who was writing on the Sect in
the <i>North American Review</i>: "The fundamental
question is the unification of religious belief. In
Persia, during the last fifty years<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> ... the various
religionists have united in the utmost love and
fellowship. No traces of discord or difference remain:
the utmost love, kindness and unity are apparent.
They live together like a single family in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
harmony and accord. Discord and strife have
passed away. Love and fellowship now prevail
instead. Whether they be Moslems, Jews, Christians,
Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Nestorians, Shiites,
Sunnis or others&mdash;no discord exists among them."
In an address at New York,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> he said:</p>

<p>"In the Orient different races were at constant
warfare until about sixty years ago Baha Ullah appeared
and caused love and unity to exist among
these various peoples. Their former animosities
have passed away entirely. It was a dark world, it
became radiant.... You now see the same
people who were formerly at enmity and strife in far-off
Persia, people of various religions and denominations
living in the utmost peace." "His Highness,
Baha Ullah, established such unity and peace between
the various communities." What does such
language mean? At their face value these words
are erroneous in a high degree. All know indeed
that in Persia bigotry and religious and racial hatred
have been modified. In bringing this result about,
Bahaism has had a share along with Western civilization
and education, the Nationalist movement, medical
missions, and even Pan-Islamism, for the latter
has tended to bring Shiahs and Sunnis nearer to
each other. But it is notorious how great the enmity
and hatred is yet; how the Kurds have raided the
Shiahs and massacred or plundered the Nestorians
and the Armenians: how the Moslems oppress the
Armenians in Karadagh: how Sheikhis have suffered from Mutasharis; and Ali Allahis continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the practice of tagiya for fear of them both. If
Parsees enjoy more ease, it is through the efforts
of their co-religionists in India; if Christians are
safer, it is through the favour of the Shahs and the
power of Christian governments: in neither case is
it due to Bahaism. The union with the Bahais of
possibly a dozen Armenians, a few score Zoroastrians
and several hundred Jews cannot be the basis for
such extravagance of language: neither can the rejection
by Baha of the Shiah notion that other religions
are "unclean," for Sunnis all along held the
"peoples of the Book" to be "clean" and Christians
of old learned to "call no man common or unclean."</p>

<p>As to unification, how is it? Babis were divided
off from Sheikhis, and Bahais from Babis, and Behais
from Bahais and the flames of hate and vindictiveness
burn hotter between them than between the
older sects and races, while the Shiahs curse and at
times persecute Babis and Bahais. Instead of unity
the Babi-Bahais have brought a greater division of
sects: instead of love renewed fires of animosity and
fanatical hate. In view of these conditions, how
unreasonable for Abdul Baha to say that "through
the power of Baha Ullah, such affection and love is
produced among the various religions of Persia that
they now associate<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> with each other in the utmost
love and concord."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing now to another phase of this subject, let
us inquire what means are prescribed for religious
unification. The chief means seems to be the forbidding
of the right of private interpretation or
opinion. Abdul Baha writes<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> that he is "the Interpreter
of all the works and books of the Blessed
Perfection. Were this not the case, every one would
give an interpretation according to his own inclination&mdash;this
would lead to great differences." This
point is more plainly stated by M. Abul Fazl:<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
"One of the explicit commands of Baha Ullah is the
ordinance abrogating differences which separate men....
If those having two points of view, engage
in strife in expressing their views, both will be delivered
to the fire.... Bahai law prohibits the
interpretation of God's word and exposition of personal
opinion ... lest different sects arise."
"You must ask him (Abdul Baha) regarding the
meaning of the texts of the verses. Whatsoever he
says is correct. Without his will, not a word shall
any one utter."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Baha Ullah "made provision
against all kinds of differences, so that no man shall
be able to create a new sect ... indicating the
Interpreter so that no man should be able to say that
he explains a certain teaching in this way and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
create a new sect."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> After Abdul Baha whenever
the House of Justice is organized, it will ward off
differences. But though the right of private judgment
was denied, yet a new sect arose and bitter
disunion occurred over the question of the Infallible
Interpreter.</p>

<p>Another Bahai scheme to promote unity is the
adoption of one language to be a universal language;
another is the amalgamation of all the races by
the marriage of blacks and whites, and all indiscriminately;
another is the discouragement of patriotism
or any special love for one's country or
people, teaching an internationalism in the words,
"Let not him glory who loves his country, but let
him glory who loves his kind." These points need
not detain us, nor need we stop to enlarge on the
fact that the new calendar, feasts, rites, laws, weights
and measures, etc., tend to disunion.</p>

<p><i>The claims of Bahaism in regard to its relation to
the movement for peace and arbitration</i> require consideration.
Abdul Baha at Boston<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> said: "Baha
Ullah spread the teaching of Universal Peace sixty
years ago, when it was <i>not even thought of</i> by the
people. He sent tablets to kings advising this."
He wrote to Mr. Smiley of Lake Mohonk, "The
matter of International Peace was instituted by His
Highness, Baha Ullah, sixty years ago in Persia."
Dreyfus<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> says: "Long before these ideas, i. e., peace,
brotherhood and arbitration, had taken form among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
us, at a time when the Bab himself had sometimes
excused the use of arms for the propagation of religion,
Baha Ullah had made these high principles the
one basis of his religion." Remey<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> states this claim
yet more strongly, saying: "Peace, arbitration, in
fact universal civilization <i>were unthought of</i>, when
over half a century ago these teachers (Baha Ullah
and Abdul Baha) announced their message." Again,
"Christ states that His dispensation is to be a militant
one, which would be followed by another of
peace. Baha Ullah has now brought that peace to
the world. He is the Prince of Peace who has established
the foundations of peace on earth."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>Now as to the facts. Bahaism certainly does
advocate peace and arbitration, in common with
Tolstoism, socialism and many schools of thought.
Baha said to Professor Browne at Acca, in 1886:
"This fruitless strife, these ruinous wars shall pass
away and the Most Great Peace shall come. These
strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease
and all men be as one kindred and one family." In
accordance with this, Abdul Baha declares<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> universal
peace and an international Court of Arbitration to be
fundamental principles of Bahaism. The Court
will be called the House of Justice and will be composed
entirely of Bahais. "Disputes will find a
final sentence of absolute justice ... before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the Bahai House of Justice. War will be suppressed."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>It is good to have such a programme approved by
one raised in a Moslem environment. Yet it is
evident that the claim to priority and originality regarding
it, constitute a grave anachronism and betray
ignorance of or perversion of history. Both the
ideals and the programme were in existence and in
partial operation long before the time of Baha
Ullah. In the first place, Bahai teachings on peace
are but an echo of Christian hopes and doctrines of
"peace on earth: good will to men." Baha has but
thrown on the screen again the vision of the seers of
Israel who foretold the age when "men shall learn
war no more." The hopes of the prophets, the
longings of saints, the anthems of the worshipping
church found voice through the Christian centuries,
with a faith never dimmed, a desire never quenched,
anticipating that</p>

<div class="inset" style="width:16em">
<p class="noin">
 "Then shall wars and tumults cease,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then be banished grief and pain,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: 0;">Righteousness and joy and peace</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Undisturbed shall ever reign."</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Baha's teaching, though growing up in Islam, is
transplanted from Christian soil. He repudiates the
teaching of Mohammed regarding "holy wars."
"The first Glad Tidings is the abolition of religious
warfare from the Book," <i>i. e.</i>, the Koran. What
Bahais would do in case of provocation,
accompanied by reasonable opportunity of success, is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>evident. The Babis were fierce warriors (1848-1850)
and the Bab expected that wars would continue.
In the "Bayan" he makes provision for the distribution
of the spoils.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Baha, together with Azal, started
for and tried to join the army at Tabarsi,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> and was
absent from participation in its sanguinary conflict,
solely because his arrest by the Persian authorities
at Amul prevented him from reaching the fort.
After his release he fell under suspicion because<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> he
"not improbably harboured designs of setting up a
standard of revolt on his own account." He was,
therefore, rearrested and sent to the capital. But
during his exile in Turkey, he tried to be reconciled
to the Shah of Persia. Following this change of
policy, he was able to claim later<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> that "for nigh
upon thirty-five years no action opposed to the
government or prejudicial to the nation has emanated
from this sect." The Bahais did not join in the effort
to establish constitutional government in 1908-1911.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
They have never had an even chance to fight
for their own cause and it remains to be seen what
they would do in such a case. There is no assurance
that they would act like Quakers or Dukhobors,
for even Abdul Baha at times identifies himself and
his cause with the fighting Babis and appropriates
their martial glory. He said to Mr. Anton Hadad:<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
"When in Persia we were very few but owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
animosity we stood before our numerous enemies,
fought and defeated them and gained the victory."
He wrote a prayer on behalf of the American army
for the use of Bahais: "O God! Strengthen its
soldiers and its flag."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> In his teachings, he leaves
several pretexts for the prosecution of war. He says:<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
"War is sometimes the foundation of peace. If, for
example, a sovereign should wage war against a
threatening foe or for the unification of the people,
this war may be attuned to peace: this fury is kindness;
this war is a source of reconciliation." In his
scheme for arbitration, one is reminded of the old
saw, "we must have peace even if we have to fight
for it." For he says: "If any nation dares to refuse
to abide by the decision of the international court, all
the other nations must arise and put down this rebellion,
... they must rise up and <i>destroy it</i>,
... band together and <i>exterminate it</i>."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>As to the claim that Baha <i>originated</i> the movement
for universal peace and international arbitration,
it only deserves consideration because it is apparently
put forth in sincerity. It absolutely contradicts
history. In fact the movement for "peace on
earth" has long been an active one in Christian
lands, and arbitration has long been recognized and
employed as a method for promoting peace." "Under
the influence of religious and feudal ideas," says
Professor Moore,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> "arbitrations were very frequent<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
in the Middle Ages, which offered the remarkable
spectacle of conciliation and peace making way."
Treaties were made which provided for arbitration.
In Italy there were one hundred arbitrations in the
thirteenth century. In the following centuries
they were frequent in Europe. Sometimes a
king acted as arbitrator between kings or between
king and people. At other times a city,
as for example the Republic of Hamburg, or a
great juristconsult or a Professor of a University
acted in this capacity. More often "the predominance
of the popes constituted them natural judges of
international cases." Projects for universal peace
were put forward. One of the most celebrated was
formed by Sully, the minister of Henry IV. The
Abbe de St. Pierre in 1713 published a scheme for
the federation of Christian States, with a central
council to decide all disputes. Grotius strongly
advocated arbitration as a means of avoiding war
and the placing of nations under obligations to settle
disputes peaceably. Bentham in the eighteenth century
proposed a plan for a common tribunal to
maintain universal and permanent peace.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Fox,
Penn and the Quakers, from Christian principles,
strenuously opposed war. There were nine principal
arbitrations between the United States and Great
Britain, France and Spain from 1794 to 1863.</p>

<p>In 1815, before Baha's day, the Massachusetts
Peace Society was formed and in the following year
the American Peace Society "to promote universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
permanent peace through arbitration and disarmament."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
For this purpose World Congresses were
held at London 1843, Brussels 1848, Paris 1849,
Frankfort 1850, London 1851, etc., and with great
enthusiasm. Men like Elihu Burritt, Victor Hugo,
Richard Cobden, John Bright and Charles Sumner
led in advocacy of the cause. Tennyson, too, saw
the vision of peace,</p>

<div class="inset" style="width : 24em">
<p class="noin">"In the Parliament of men, the Federation of the World,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noin">and the Scottish bard declared,</p>

<div class="inset" style="width : 14em">
<p class="noin">"It's coming yet for a' that<br />
When man to man, the world o'er,<br />
Shall brothers be and a' that."</p>
</div>

<p>We can easily conceive how these ideas would penetrate
the Near East and how Baha Ullah in Turkey
caught an echo of them and was happily influenced
to become himself an advocate of peace.</p>

<p>But what becomes of the claims of Abdul Baha
and other Bahais, mentioned above, that Baha, in
1863-1867, "<i>instituted</i> the movement for peace and
arbitration" that he advised it to kings "when it
had not even been thought of," "before the attention
of Western thinkers had to any degree been directed
towards universal peace." They are like so many
claims made by Bahaists, utterly groundless. Such
statements, when made by Abdul Baha, we may attribute
to ignorance of the history of the Occident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
but this does not excuse American advocates of
Bahaism for endorsing such errors.</p>

<p>I need not discuss the assertion of Bahais that the
Millennium began in 1844<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> or at latest in 1892, nor the
announcement that the Most Great Peace will be inaugurated
in 1917, which they declare to be the end
of the 1335 days of Dan. xii. 12.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p><i>Another claim made for Bahaism is that it is a
rational and undogmatic religion.</i> Remey<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> says:
"It does not put forth doctrine or dogma....
It is a religion free from dogma." It is "logical and
reasonable." Dreyfus denounces "dogmatic religions,"
and claims that Bahaism has paved the way
for the harmony of religion with free thought."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
With these accord the words of Abdul Baha to Pastor
Monnier in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> "Our aim is to free religion
from dogmas. Dogmas are the cause of strife. We
must give up dogmas." Now it is evident that
Bahaism has not a fixed body of doctrines: that it
has not a definite and clear system of theology. But
it is very dogmatic in the common usages of that
word. Webster defines it as (1) positive, authoritative,
and (2) as asserting or disposed to assert with
authority or with overbearing and arrogance. Is not
Bahaism a mass of assertions? For example, Baha
declares that "the universe hath neither beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
nor ending." Abdul Baha adds the comment:<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
"<i>By this simple statement</i> he has set aside elaborate
theories and exhaustive labours of scientists and
philosophers." Similarly he is said to have settled
by a single word all discussions about divine sovereignty
and free agency. Abdul Baha might be
called the Lord of dogmas, for from his dicta none
must vary by a hair's breadth. Remey himself dogmatizes
as follows: "The religion of Baha is the
cause of God, outside of which there is no truth in
the world." Much in Bahaism must be taken on
faith, without logical proof. Professor Browne<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> puts
it mildly when he says: "The system appears to
me to contain enough of the mysterious and the
transcendental to make its intellectual acceptance at
least as difficult as the theology of most Christian
churches to the sceptic." Elsewhere he says:<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> "It
must be clearly understood that Babism (or Bahaism)
is in no sense latitudinarian or eclectic, and stands
therefore in the sharpest antagonism to Sufism.
However vague Babi doctrine may be on certain
points, it is essentially <i>dogmatic</i>, and every utterance
or command uttered by the Manifestation of the
Period, <i>i. e.</i>, Bab or Baha Ullah or Abbas Effendi
must be accepted without reserve."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Similarly
Dr. G. W. Holmes<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> writes: "Baha's appeal is only
to his own word and to his own arbitrary and forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
interpretation of the Word of God, which interpretations,
as he states, find their sanction solely in his
own authority."</p>

<p>There are other claims of Bahaism of a specific nature
which might be considered. They would be
found equally assertive and equally groundless.
Bahaism reminds me of a horse which was offered
for sale in Persia. It appeared like a fat and well
fed animal. But the would-be purchaser was warned
that its skin had been puffed up with air which
would soon leak out, and he would have on his
hands a lean, lank, bony <i>yabi</i> scrub. Bahaism does
not even stop short of claiming that the civilization
of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is due to
it. Its braggart attitude may be fittingly symbolized
by Rostand's "Chanticler," standing in the barnyard,
flapping its wings in vain exultation, imagining
that it, by its crowing, has caused the sun to rise.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="h2">Bahaism and Christianity</p>

<blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>The whole Bahai movement is in fact, whatever it may have
been in the mind of its originator the Bab, a counterfeit of the
Messiahship of Christ. At least this is the side of it that is turned
towards both Christians and Jews. All that relates to the second
coming of Christ in the Old Testament or the New is bodily appropriated
by Baha to himself and everything in them relating to
God is boldly applied to himself.... It will bring a few of
the Persians nearer to Christ. By far the greater number of its adherents
will be brought into more active antagonism to Christianity
than before.&mdash;<i>G. W. Holmes, M. D., in Speer's "Missions and
Modern History," Vol. I, p. 169.</i><br />
<br />
Can Bahaism make good its claim to be the fulfillment of and
substitute for Christianity? It has no place for Christ except as
one of a series, one, moreover, whose brief day of authority closed
when Mohammed began to preach in Mecca.... If the
claim be admitted that Bahaism is a republication of Christianity,
the whole interpretation of the death of Christ contained in the
Epistles must first be rejected.&mdash;<i>W. A. Shedd, in "Miss. Rev. of
World," 1911.</i>
</blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">ABDUL BAHA<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> says: "Some say Abdul Baha
is Antichrist. They are not informed of
Bahai principles. Baha Ullah<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> established
Christ in the East. He has praised Christ, honoured
Christ, exalted Him, called Him the Word of God,
the Spirit of God, and spread His mention."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> These
words could be written with the name Mohammed
substituted for Baha Ullah. But in the case of both
of them it is the kiss of betrayal. Judas also made
known Jesus. Both Mohammed and Baha write
"ex" before His title "King of Kings." To accept
Baha and Abdul Baha is to deny and forsake Christ.</p>

<p>I hear some Christian say: "Of course. What
you say is self-evident. Bahaism is a new religion
whose aim is to supplant Christianity." This is
true. Yet <i>the claim</i> is put forth by Bahais, and,
more strangely, it is accepted by some Christians,
<i>that the two religions are not antagonistic, and may
be held at one time by the same person</i>. To an esteemed
Christian lady I expressed my regret that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>a certain doctor, forsaking Christ, had gone as a
Bahai missionary to Persia. The reply startled me:
"Doctor&mdash;&mdash;is very much a Christian." Yet
why was I startled? It was simply hearing an idea
with which I was familiar in the writings of the
Bahais. Sydney Sprague says: "The true Bahai is
also the truest Christian."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Charles M. Remey
says: "To be a real Christian in spirit is to be a
Bahai, and to be a real Bahai is to be a Christian,"
for "Bahai teaching is only the perfection of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
A report of an interview of Rev. R. J.
Campbell, of City Temple, London, with Abdul
Baha, states the claim of Bahaism as follows: "It
does not seek to proselyte. One can be a Bahai
without ceasing to be a Christian, a Jew, or a Mohammedan."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
In accordance with this idea, Thornton
Chase and some Bahais in America continued
to worship and teach in Christian churches, and to
have their dead buried by pastors. Some in London,
in connection with the City Temple and St.
John's Church (Canon Wilberforce's), profess both
Christianity and Bahaism. Of Southern India,
Dr. A. L. Wylie said: "It is said that there are
thirty-five Bahais in our city [Ratnagiri]. Some of
these are Christian converts. They continue to be
Christians, saying that they can remain such and
are instructed to do so." Such an erroneous idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> when not due to the misrepresentations of the leaders
and Oriental <i>tagiya</i> ("dissimulation"), must arise
from ignorance of or dislike to true Christianity or
ignorance of what Bahaism is.</p>

<p>I. Bahaism assigns Christianity a place as but
one among the true religions. Bahaism indorses
and accepts in the same category with Judaism
and Christianity, as true and divinely revealed religions,
Zoroastrianism, Confucianism, Brahmanism,
Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Babism, and Bahaism.
Abdul Baha says: "The reality of the religions is
one, the difference is one of imitation."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Remey says:
"Bahais consider all religions to be, from a spiritual
standpoint, one religion."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> "Every religion has had
its birth in the advent of its divine founder."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> "The
founders of the world religions have been seers as
well as channels of truth to the people."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> It tries
to build on all the other religions by professing to
be the fulfillment of each one. "The Bahai propaganda
in India," says Sprague, "has not the difficulty
that besets a Christian missionary, that of pulling
down: his duty is only to build on what is
already there. He sees the Hindu, Buddhist, and
Mohammedan with the same eye, acknowledges
their truth and shows that a further revelation has
come through Baha Ullah."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> It says to each one,
Baha fulfills your traditions and prophecies.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>But this liberality is only apparent. Only original
Buddhism, Christianity, etc., was God-given and
true. Now all are corrupted. "The key-note of
Bahai teaching is identical with the Christian, but in
Christianity it was so forgotten that it came almost
as a fresh, new illumination from Baha."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>Christianity refuses to be classed with the ethnic
religions. In its nature it is exclusive. It admits
that there is a measure of truth in all religions, but
Christ's gospel is the truth "once for all" delivered
to men.</p>

<p>II. Bahaism claims to abrogate and supersede
Christianity. Bahaism in its origin is a Mohammedan
sect. It declares that Islam is from God.
Christianity was a divine revelation, but Islam was
a better one. In the "Ikan," Baha maintains the
validity of Islam, testifies to its truth, defends Mohammed's
prophetic mission as the fulfillment of the
New Testament prophecies, and the Koran as the
Book of God.
<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
Abdul Baha exalts Mohammed, and
declares that he "gave more spiritual education
than any of the others,"<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> <i>i. e.</i>, than Moses or Jesus.
He justifies Mohammed's life and conduct, and defends
his laws and doctrines."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He declares that
"whatever European and American historians have
written regarding His Highness Mohammed, the
Messenger of God, is mostly falsehood.... The
narrators are either ignorant or antagonistic."
<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>

Christians have therefore been in the wrong for
thirteen centuries. They have sinned against God,
and were a stiff-necked and perverse people in rejecting
Mohammed, as the Jews were in rejecting
Jesus the Christ. "If those who have accepted a
revelation refuse to believe a subsequent revelation,
their faith becomes null and void."</p>

<p>Similarly Babism abrogated Islam. At the Badasht
(Shahrud) Conference (1848) the law of the
Koran was formally declared to be annulled. Baha
abrogated Babism in the Rizwan at Bagdad in 1864.
Bahaism is the New Covenant, "which confirms and
completes all religious teaching which has gone before."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Christianity is, according to this, a system of the
distant past. It was effective in its day, for "the
Christian teaching <i>was</i> illumined by the Sun of
Truth: the Christian civilization <i>was</i> the best,"<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> concedes
Abdul Baha. But now, says Remey, "Bahaism
is not one of many phases of Universal Truth,
but <i>the Truth</i>, the only Living Truth to-day, ...
the only source of Divine Knowledge to mankind....
Abdul Baha's word is the Truth....
There are those who will say, 'Have we not Jesus?
We want no other.' The Revelation of Jesus is no
longer the Point of Guidance to the world. We are
in total blindness if we refuse this new Revelation
which is the end of the Revelations of the past....
All the teachings of the past are past....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Only that which is revealed by the Supreme Pen,
Baha Ullah, and that which issues from the Centre
of the Covenant, Abdul Baha, is spiritual food."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
Bahaism in proclaiming thus the abrogation of
Christianity is emphatically antichristian.</p>

<p>III. Bahaism casts Christ from His throne as the
unique manifestation of God. Bahaism recognizes
two classes of prophets: (1) The independent prophets,
who were lawgivers and founders of new cycles. Of
this class were Abraham, Moses, Christ, Mohammed,
the Bab, and Baha. (2) The others are dependent
prophets, who are as "branches." Such were Isaiah
and Daniel. All the greater prophets, of the first
class, were Manifestations of God.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> So Bahaism
continues to honour Christ as the Incarnate Word,
the Spirit of God, God manifest in the flesh. At the
same time it exalts Baha to supreme and unique dignity
and glory above Christ and all prophets. In
order to understand this essential, fundamental doctrine
of Bahaism, we must know its doctrine concerning
God and His Manifestation.</p>

<p>The teaching of Bahaism regarding God is hard to
grasp, because it oscillates between Theism and Pantheism.
Myron Phelps' exposition of it is certainly
pantheistic.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Baha Ullah in many places bears out
his interpretation, as, for example, "God alone is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the one Power which animates and dominates all
things, which are but manifestations of its energy."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>
In subsequent expositions, as in "Answered Questions,"
Abdul Baha repudiates Pantheism, and so
does M. Abul Fazl in "The Brilliant Proof." Kheiralla,
while maintaining that Baha taught Theism,
accused Abdul Baha of Pantheism. In "The Epistle
to the Shah" Baha simulates a monotheism almost
as rigid as Islam: "We bear witness that there is no
God but Him. He is independent of the worlds.
No one hath known Him.... God singly and
alone abideth in His own place which is holy, above
space or time, mention and utterance, sign, description,
definition, height and depth.... The way
is closed and seeking is forbidden." A favourite text
is that of the Koran, in which God says: "I was a
hid treasure, I desired to be known, therefore I
created the world." In this process "the first thing
which emanated from God [eternally] was that universal
reality which the ancient philosophers termed
the 'First Mind,' and which the people of Baha call
the 'Primal Will.' This is without beginning or end,
essentially but not temporally contingent, and without
power to become an associate with God."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
The Primal Will, Holy Essence, Word, Spirit, is manifested
in perfect men, who are the Great Prophets.
They are supreme, holy, sinless souls, godlike in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
attributes. They show the perfections of God.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> This
reality does not change, but the garment in which it is
clothed is different. One day it is the garment of
Abraham, who is Zoroaster, then Moses, Buddha,
Krishna, Christ, Mohammed, the Bab, and Baha
Ullah.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Abul Fazl says: "All the prophets are respectively
the Manifestations of the single Reality
and one Essence."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The "Ikan" says: "All are
one, as the sun of yesterday and to-day are one. The
sun is one, the dawning-points of the sun are numerous.
One light, many lanterns."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> "Baha is
the same light in a new lamp."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Yet there are differences
in degree. Of the Bab, Baha says: "His
rank is greater than all the prophets, and His Mission
loftier and higher."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> But he is merely as a
forerunner in comparison with Baha. Baha is superior
to all, greater, more glorious.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> He is infallible,
absolute, universal. "All the prophets were
perfect mirrors of God, but <i>in Baha</i>,
<i>in some sense</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><i>the Divine Essence is manifested</i>."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> "All preceding
ones are inferior to him: all subsequent ones are to
be under his shadow."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> But even the latter are not
to come for a "thousand or thousands of years," and
perhaps not then, for the "Kitab-ul-Akdas" says:
"O Pen, write and inform mankind that the Manifestations
are ended by this luminous and effulgent
Theophany."</p>

<p>The Manifestation has two stations: "One is the
station of oneness and the rank of absolute Deity,
the second station is one of temporal conditions and
servitude. If the manifestation says, 'Verily I am
only a man like you,' or 'Verily, I am God,' each is
true and without doubt." The "Tajallayat" quotes
the Bab as saying concerning "Him whom God
shall manifest"; "Verily he shall utter, 'I am God.
There is no God but Me, the Lord of all things, and
all besides is created by Me! O ye, my creatures,
ye are to worship Me.'"<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> In Bahai literature such
words as the following are not uncommon: "Baha
Ullah is the Lord of Hosts, the Heavenly Father, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>

passing, it may be noticed how little ground for such
boasting they have. How great in comparison was
the influence of Moses as leader of Israel, emancipator,
lawgiver, and prophet! How great even was Mohammed's
success and influence, compared with what
Baha has accomplished! How evidently antichristian
is Bahaism in denying that Christ's name and glory are
above all, and that to Him every knee should bow!</p>

<p>IV. Bahaism wrongly assumes that its leader is
Christ come again. There is confusion about this
claim, for some Bahais represent Baha to be Christ,
and others make Abdul Baha Abbas to be Christ
come the second time. Confusion also arises from
the fact that Baha is set forth as the Manifestation of
all the "promised ones." He is set forth as the
Messiah for the Jews, God the Father, the Word,
and the Spirit for the Christians, Aurora or Shah
Bahram for the Zoroastrians, the fifth Buddha for
Buddhists, reincarnated Krishna for Brahmans, the
Mahdi or the twelfth Imam or Husain for the
Moslems.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> "All are realized in the coming of Baha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Ullah."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> In accord with this, Baha declared in his
"Epistle to the Pope": "Consider those who turned
away from the Spirit [Christ] when He came to them.
Verily He hath come from heaven as He came the
first time. Beware lest ye oppose Him as the Pharisees
opposed Him. Verily the Spirit of Truth has
come to guide you into all truth. He hath come
from the Heaven of Pre&euml;xistence." "Baha," says
the editor of the <i>Star of the West</i>, "is the fulfillment
of the promise of the 'second coming' <i>with a new
name</i> (Rev. iii. 11-13)."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>It must be remembered that Bahaism, chameleon-like,
takes on a different aspect according to the
environment of its adherents. In Persia its creed is
different from that of America in regard to the "return."
For the most part American Bahais regard
Baha as God the Father, and Abdul Baha
Abbas as the Son of God, Jesus Christ. After the
quarrel and schism following the death of Baha
(1892), Abbas became very wary of assuming titles
and dignities, lest he give a handle to his opponents
to accuse him of claiming to be a "Manifestation."
So he assumed the title Abd-ul-Baha, the "servant of
Baha," which his followers translate "Servant of
God." He also calls himself the "Centre of the
Covenant." Baha had entitled him the "Greatest
Branch of God" (Zech. vi. 12) and the "Mystery of
God" (1 Tim. iii. 16). He was commonly called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
"Agha," an equivalent in Persia of Effendi or Mister,
but his followers translate it "Master," and put into
it the full New Testament significance. Undoubtedly
Western Bahais worship Abdul Baha as Jesus Christ
the Master come again. In spite of all disavowals
and beclouding by words, their faith is plain.
Getsinger, a leader and missionary, says: "Abbas is
heir and Master of the Kingdom: he was on earth
1,900 years ago as the Nazarene." Mrs. Corinne
True says: "If this is not the resurrection of the
pure Spirit of the Nazarene of 1,900 years ago, then
we need not look elsewhere."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Mr. Anton Hadad
says: "The Master, Abbas Effendi, the Lord of the
Kingdom, is the one who was to renew and drink
the cup with his disciples in the Kingdom of the
Father, the one who taught the world to pray, 'Thy
kingdom come,'" <i>i. e.</i>, Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Chase says:

Mrs. Brittingham, on pilgrimage to Acca, writes: "I
have seen the King in his beauty, the Master is here
and we need not look for another. This is the return
of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, of the Lamb that
once was slain;&mdash;the Glory of God and the Glory
of the Lamb."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>Emphasizing the side of his divinity, we have such
declarations as these: M. Haydar Ali taught Mrs.
Goodall, "God is not realized except through His
Manifestations. Now you have recognized Him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have come to see Him,"<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> <i>i. e.</i>, Abdul Baha (1908).
M. Asad Ullah gave instructions (1914): "This
world has an owner, and Abdul Baha owns the world
and all that is in it."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> "He is the Son of God"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>&mdash;the
only Door, "the Lord of Mankind."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> A supplication
from Persia, given out for publication,
says: "O! Abdul Baha! Forgiver of sins, merciful,
bountiful, compassionate! How can a sinner like

of Sins."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>But there is an interpretation to all this for "those
of understanding." Bahais reject metempsychosis,
but they have a doctrine of "Return," which must
be borne in mind. This principle is expressed by
Phelps as follows: "When a character with which
we are familiar as possessed by some individual of
the past, reappears in another individual of the present,
we say that the former has returned."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Baha
states it thus: "In every succeeding Manifestation
those souls who exceed all in faith, assurance, and
self-denial can be declared to be the return of the
former persons who attained to these states in the
preceding Manifestation. For that which appeared
from the former servants became manifest in the
subsequent ones."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> Their classic illustration of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is John the Baptist. Abdul Baha says: "Christ said
that John the Baptist was Elijah. The same perfections
which were in Elijah existed in John, and were
exactly realized in him. Not the essence but the
qualities are regarded. As the flower of last year has
returned, so this person, John, was a manifestation of
the bounty, perfections, the character, the qualities,
and the virtues of Elias. John said, 'I am not
Elias'&mdash;not his substance and individuality."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>
Remey clearly states the idea: "The return of a
prophet does not refer to the return to this world of
a personality. It refers to the return in another
personality of the impersonal Spirit, the Word or
Spirit of God, which spoke through the prophets in
the past.... People are mistakenly looking
for the personal <i>individual</i> return of their own special
prophet."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> In accordance with this theory of
the "Return," Abdul Baha wrote to the Bahai Council
of New York: "I am not Christ; I am not
eternal."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> To Mrs. Grundy he said: "Some call
me Christ; it is imagination."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Yet the final word
of his missionary, Mr. Remey, is: "The same Christ
which was in Jesus is again manifest in the Bahai
Revelation. The real Christians are those who recognize
the New Covenant to be the return of the
same Christ,&mdash;the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> In like manner
this usurper of Christ's name is proclaimed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"the expected one," the "desire of all nations"
under other names to the various religions.</p>

<p>V. Bahaism deals with the prophecies of the
Bible in a manner derogatory to the glory of the
Lord Jesus Christ and His Kingdom. Bahaism asserts
that "the promises and prophecies given in the
Holy Scriptures have been fulfilled by the appearance
of the Prince of the Universe, the great Baha
Ullah and of Abdul Baha."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> A volume would be
necessary to review their treatment of the prophecies.
They quote a multitude of verses without proof that
their applications are valid. The "messenger" and
"Elijah" of the Book of Malachi are declared to be
the Bab.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> He is also the Angel with the sound of
the trumpet (Rev. iv. 1) and his cycle is the "First
Resurrection." Baha is declared to be the fulfillment
of Isaiah's prophecies. Of chapter ix. 1-6,
"unto us a child is born, ... the Prince of
Peace." Dealy says: "Many misguided people
have referred this to Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> In verse 1,
"Galilee of the nations," land of Zebulun and Naphtali,
is made to mean Acca (Acre in Syria) where
Baha lived in exile, and not the region of Christ's
ministry, contradicting Matthew iv. 13-16. By a
great stretch of imagination Acca<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> becomes Jerusalem, "the city of the great king" (Ps. xlviii. 12), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Mount Carmel becomes Mount Zion, and Isaiah ii. 3
refers to them, "for out of Zion shall go forth the
law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
Even "the root out of Jesse"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> and the millennial
peace are only partially referred to Christ. They
find the real fulfillment in Baha Ullah, whom they
imagine to be descended from Abraham, through an
imaginary descendant of his named Jesse.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> The new
covenant and the law written on the heart is again
the Bahai dispensation, contrary to Hebrews viii.
8, 10, 16. When Baha as a prisoner in chains rode
into Acca seated on an ass, he fulfilled Zechariah ix. 9.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>I attended a Bahai meeting in the Masonic Temple
in Chicago. The leader read the following verses
as all fulfilled in Bahaism.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> The "son of man"
(Dan. vii.) was Abdul Baha, and the "Ancient of
Days," Baha. The question of Proverbs xxx. 3,
"What is his name and what his son's name?" was
answered, Baha and Abdul Baha; similarly in Psalms
lxxii. and ii., "The King" and the "King's Son."
The "Branch" (Zech. vi. 12-13) who shall build the
temple was again Abdul Baha, and the latter is
specially urgent that the Bahai Temple in Chicago
should be built in his day, so that the prophecy may
appear to be fulfilled. The dates in Daniel are
juggled with. For example, Abdul Baha explains
Daniel viii. by taking the <i>solar</i> year. He calculates
<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that the 2,300 days were completed at the Bab's
manifestation in 1844. In Daniel xii. 6 the <i>lunar</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
year is resorted to, and the forty-two months (1,260
years) are dated from the hegira of Mohammed, but
Daniel xii. 11 does not come exactly right, so the
<i>terminus a quo</i> is made to be the proclamation of
the prophethood of Mohammed, three years after
his mission, which was ten years before the hegira.
By this means the date of Baha's manifestation (1863)
is reached. In connection with Daniel xii. and
Revelation xi. we have the startling information, so
contradictory to history, that "in the beginning of
the seventh century after Christ, when Jerusalem
was conquered, the Holy of Holies was outwardly
preserved, that is to say, the house which Solomon
built. The Holy of Holies was preserved, guarded,
and respected."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> On this alleged fact Abdul Baha
founds an argument.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Prophecies referring to the
glory of God or of the Father are applied to Baha,
because his title means "glory of God." The Bab,
according to the custom in Persia, gave many high-sounding
titles. Baha's rival was called "The Dawn
of the Eternal." Voliva, the successor of Dowie,
might assume some fitting title and claim to fulfill
the prophecies. He has a good foundation for interpretation,
he does really live in Zion City (Illinois).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Our Bahais further tell us that the "New Jerusalem,"
the new heaven and the new earth, mean the new
dispensation, the new laws of Baha. This is now
"the day of God," "the day of judgment," "the
kingdom of God," "the second resurrection."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> The
parable of the vineyard is a favourite proof text. It
says that the Lord of the vineyard will come <i>himself</i>
and will utterly destroy the wicked husbandmen.
This, they say, is a real coming of the Father, even
as the Son came. In that case the destroying must
be real, and we should expect that Baha would have
destroyed the religious leaders of Mecca or Kerbela,
Jerusalem or Rome. "No," says the Bahai, "the
destroying is figurative, and means simply the abrogation
of their authority." Well, if he escapes to
a figurative interpretation, we too can interpret the
coming of the Lord of the Vineyard as his visitation
on Jerusalem in the time of Titus.</p>

<p>Baha Ullah's method of interpretation and adaptation
of prophecies is best seen in his "Ikan." In it
he interprets at length Matthew xxiv.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> In brief it is
as follows: "After the tribulation of those days"
means times of difficulty in understanding God's
word and attaining divine knowledge; "the sun
shall be darkened and the moon cease to give light,"
that is the teachings and the ordinances of the preceding
dispensation shall lose their influence and
efficiency. "The stars shall fall," etc., means the
divines shall fall from the knowledge of religion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the powers of science and religion shall be shaken.
Because of the absence of the Son of Divine Beauty,
the moon of knowledge, and the stars of intuitive
wisdom, "all the tribes of the earth shall mourn."
"They shall see the Son of Man coming in the
clouds of heaven," that is Baha Ullah shall appear
from the heaven of the Supreme Will, outwardly
from his mother's womb. "In the clouds" means
in doubts which are caused by the human limitations
of the Manifestation, eating, drinking, marrying, etc.
"And he shall send his angels," the spiritual believers
sent as preachers of Baha. The separation
of the sheep from the goats, as we learn subsequently,
means the schism at the death of Baha,
when the violators, the brothers of Abdul Baha and
their adherents, were exscinded.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Even granting an
allegorical interpretation of Christ's words, only a
stretch of imagination can find any reference to
Baha.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that Oriental Bahai
writers have read Keith on Prophecy in Persian and
the publications of the Mission Press at Beirut.
Abdul Baha said to Dr. H. H. Jessup, "I am familiar
with the books of your press."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> M. Abul Fazl refers to and quotes them. Writers in English (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Kheiralla, Remey, Dealy, and Brittingham) refer to
Miller, Cummings, Seiss, Guinness, and others. Yet
with all their familiarity with apocalyptic literature,
they make an exceedingly weak presentation. Their
claims are so baseless as to require no refutation.
They are a mass of unfounded assertions and assumptions,&mdash;vain,
bold, and brazen. We may admit
the declarations of Baha and Abul Fazl, which are
but trite principles of hermeneutics, that figurative
and allegorical language abounds in the Scriptures,
that many meanings are "sealed" till after their fulfillment,
that the prophecies of the Old Testament
were only partially fulfilled at Christ's first coming.
But their inference does not follow. There is nothing
to prove the assertions that the prophecies were
fulfilled in the Bab and Baha. They furnish no
scintilla of evidence. For example, "the government
shall be upon his shoulders." Was this fulfilled
in Baha? He came and went; the nations and
their rulers from 1817 to 1892 were neither literally
nor figuratively under his sway. He did not nor
does he rule over the nations. He did not reign in
Mount Zion nor in Jerusalem. Jerusalem did not
cease to be trodden down of the Gentiles. Abundance
of peace did not attend him, but great wars.
The signs of Christ's Second Advent have not been
fulfilled in Baha, either actually or metaphorically.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
As well may Ahmad Quadiani or Dowie assert their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
pretensions. Baha's claim is antichristian. The day
of Christ's power through the Holy Spirit has not
passed. It is still His day. The knowledge of
Christ is yet more covering the earth. Men of
diverse races and religions in Asia, Africa, and the
isles of the seas are being joined in the common faith
and fellowship of Jesus Christ as Saviour of Men.
There are more Christians in Korea than Bahais in
Persia. More Jews have become Christian since
Baha was born than have become Bahais from all
races and religions outside of Persia. Christ still
goes forth conquering and to conquer.</p>

<p>VI. Bahaism, in its treatment of Jesus Christ as a
man in His earthly life, belittles Him by both its
denials and its affirmations. Of His temptation it
says, "the devil signifies the human nature of Christ,
through which He was tempted." His miracles of
healing are denied.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> Baha and Abul Fazl admit the

"Christ by saying that He would be three

"The ascension of Christ with an elemental body is
contrary to science." He ascended in the same
sense as Baha ascended, viz., departed to the other
world. Thus Bahaism denies the miracles,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> atonement,

the denial and refutation of miracles. A blind man in
Teheran sent to Baha praying that his eyes might be
opened. He received answer that it was for the
glory of God that he remain blind. The Bab, at his
examination in Tabriz, was asked to restore the sick
Mohammed Shah to health. He replied: "It is not
in my power, but I can write two thousand verses a
day. Who else can do that?" He thus appealed
not simply to the quality of his poetry but to its
quantity as a proof of his manifestation. In like
manner, Manes, in old times, painted pictures in his
"revelations" and appealed to them as proof of his
inspiration. While denying miracles, Bahais lay
much stress, as we have seen, on minute fulfillments
of prophecies.</p>

<p>Bahaism belittles the life and work of Jesus in instituting
comparisons between Christ and Baha
derogatory to the former. Baha says: "It is not
meet ... to repeat the error of seeking help of
... the Son Jesus. Let thy satisfaction be in myself."
Abdul Baha says: "The difference between
Baha and Christ is that between the sun and moon.
The light of the sun [Baha] subsists in itself while
the moon gets light from the Sun." "All the teachings
of Christ will not exceed ten pages.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> Those of
the Blessed Perfection exceed sixty or seventy
volumes. Christ's instructions refer to individuals.
Those of the Blessed Perfection are for all nations,
although they apply as well to all individuals. The
instructions of Christ were heard by but few persons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
there were eleven who believed, although Christians
say there were one hundred and twenty. The teachings
of the Blessed Perfection were spread throughout
the world during his lifetime. The reputation of
Christ did not extend from Nazareth to Acca [22
miles]; the reputation of the Blessed Perfection extended
throughout the world. Jesus Christ did not
send a letter even to a village chief; the Blessed
Perfection sent letters to all the kings of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
Notice how he repeats <i>ad nauseam</i> the title for Baha,
but uses no title for the Lord Jesus Christ, though the
Moslems invariably do use a title in speaking of the
latter.</p>

<p>There is an evident effort on the part of Kheiralla
and Abul Fazl to minimize the proofs regarding
Christ from prophecy, miracles, and history, with
the idea thereby of magnifying the proof for Baha
in contrast. For example, "The Gospels contain
only a few pages of the true Words of God. Christ's
teachings were not written in the original language
nor written in His day, His power was slow in proving
effective, and many even denied His existence."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
"Even Peter denied Him, but Baha Ullah has educated
thousands of souls, faithful under the menace
of the sword."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> In explaining the progress of Bahaism
among the Jews and Zoroastrians, Abul Fazl
says: "Christians could not convert even one Jew
or Zoroastrian except by force or compulsion." He
ignores the fact that millions of Persians had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
converted to Christ from Zoroaster before the sword
of Islam smote Persia. This belittling of Christ&mdash;His
life and work and influence&mdash;shows that a spirit
antagonistic to Christ really animates the Bahai
leaders, in spite of their professions to the contrary.</p>

that none is to be expected "for a thousand or thousands of years."
Persia has had numerous incarnations, so-called. They were found among
the Ismielis, Assassins, Ali-Allahis and all the <i>Ghulat</i>. The veiled Prophet
Mukanna, Babak and many pretenders have proclaimed themselves God.
In truth Persia never lacks for an incarnation or two. One of these, of the
Ali-Allahi sect, arrived in Tabriz some years ago, and made an appointment
to visit me at three o'clock P. M. My somavar was set to boiling and I
awaited his arrival. But he failed to keep his engagement because the
Governor-General, the Amir-i-Nizam, heard of his presence in the city, and
this God fled, forgetting to send me word not to expect him.</p></div>

<p>VII. BAHAISM<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> teaches another way of salvation.
Man's origin and destiny were formerly points of
doubt in Bahai teaching, but the muddy mixture has
settled enough to give us a clearer view, at least as
regards Western Bahaism, though pantheistic notions
still prevail. Abdul Baha teaches that matter is
eternal, self-existent, and fills all space.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> "God always
had a creation; the universe has neither beginning
nor end."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> "Creation out of nothing is unthinkable.
Separate entities come into being through the operation
of God&mdash;are the perceptible manifestations of
Him." "There are four degrees of spirit concerned
with evolutionary growth: The mineral spirit, the
vegetable, the animal, and the human. The mineral
spirit contains the latent principle of life."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> Yet
man's origin is not from the animals.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> "Species is
fixed; man was developed gradually as a distinct

an action from an actor, a writing from a writer&mdash;a
manifestation of the Divine but not a division from
it. Sin arises from the physical qualities, from the
physical nature which we derive from Adam. Evil
is really non-existent; it is simply lack of good
qualities. There is no Satan.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> The "Genii" (jins)
of the Koran are evil passions in man; demons are
the spirits of bad men.</p>

<p>As to the doctrine of personal immortality, there
has been much confusion of thought. Some have
understood the doctrine of "rijat" or "Return" as
teaching transmigration of souls. Others have understood
their allegorizing about heaven as a rejection
of the future life. Others, as Phelps,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> affirm the absorption
of the soul in the Infinite. My language
teacher in Persia, a fervent Behai, said: "We believe
in a future state so unthinkably ecstatic that if
its joys were now revealed to men, they would
commit suicide to hasten their entrance into it."
Baha Ullah wrote a "Tablet of the Spiritual World,"
of which it is said:<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> "All who read it are filled with
an anxious desire to leave this world and enter the
next condition, so wonderful are the glories of the
spiritual kingdom. In Persia one man who read the
tablet killed himself. He could not wait for the
happiness it promised him. Another, a youth of
Ispahan, could not stand it and lost his reason."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grundy<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> and Mr. Phelps<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> understood Abdul
Baha to teach the annihilation of the wicked, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
he denied this<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> and affirms their conscious existence.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
Heaven and hell are affirmed in some places, denied
in others.</p>

<p>Sin is little dwelt upon in Bahai literature, and the
word repentance is seldom used. In the "New
History" and "Traveller's Narrative" sin, transgression,
forgiveness, expiation and such words find
no place in the indexes. The Moslem appeal for
mercy is rarely made. In the chapter on prayer, in
the "Sacred Mysteries," there are no directions for
the confession of sins, no petition like, "forgive us
our trespasses," no cry of the prodigal&mdash;"Father, I
have sinned." There is no atonement. The daily
sacrifice of the Book of Numbers is explained to
mean "Divine bounty." "The blood of Christ
cleanses us" is interpreted "His spiritual teaching
and love which saved His disciples from the
ruin of ignorance and heedlessness." The stages of
travel to God, the "Seven Valleys," are (1) research,
(2) love, (3) knowledge, (4) union, (5) content, (6) perplexity
or astonishment, (7) poverty and annihilation.
There is no mention of hatred of sin, turning
from it and apprehending the mercy of God.
The plan of salvation has neither the Christian idea
of atonement by a mediator, nor the Mohammedan
one of expiation by works of merit or an equivalent.
Its plan of salvation is simple, viz., to believe in and
follow Mirza Husain Ali, Baha Ullah, as the supreme
and final manifestation in this universal cycle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
began in Adam and culminated in Baha Ullah, who
was God the Father in the flesh. Later Bahais put
Abdul Baha in the place of Christ as Son of God
and Divine Mediator. Remey's chapter on Eternal
Life<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> is orthodoxy with Baha as "Word of God."
The doctrines of faith, regeneration, and sanctification
are Christian with the historic Christ eliminated.
Error has clothed itself as in garments of light.
Antichrist would steal the livery of Heaven and
lead Christians to forget that there is no other name
under Heaven given among men, whereby we must
be saved (Acts iv. 12), and that if Abdul Baha or an
angel from Heaven pervert the Gospel of Christ or
preach any other Gospel, he is to be rejected (Gal. i.
7-9).</p>

<p>VIII. Bahaism abrogates the New Testament.</p>

<p>It is indeed honoured, but as the Revelation of a
past dispensation. Abdul Baha wrote in the Bible
in the City Temple, London: "This book is the
Holy Book of God, of celestial inspiration. It is the
Bible of salvation, the noble Gospel. It is the
mystery of the Kingdom of God and its light. It is
the Divine bounty, sign of the guidance of God."
But Harold Johnson, a friend of Bahaism, wrote,
with true discernment:<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> "In the same spirit he
would have written the same words upon the <i>Koran</i>
or the <i>Vedas</i>." Baha certifies the <i>Koran</i> times without
number in the "Ikan." He wrote:<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> "Whoso
hath not acknowledged the <i>Koran</i> hath not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
reality accepted the books which preceded it." By
the same reasoning, whoso does not acknowledge
Baha's writings as "revealed" rejects the former
books also.</p>

<p>Bahais, even Persian Bahais, are familiar with the
Bible. They quote largely from the prophets, the
Gospels, and the Book of Revelation. They use
them for apologetic purposes, to dispute with Christians
and to find proofs for their perverted teachings.
As the real Scriptures for the present age, they present
the writings of Baha Ullah and Abdul Baha.
These are read at their meetings and in their devotions
and are chanted at their shrines. These <i>only</i>
are to be read in the <i>Mashrak-ul-Azhar</i>, the Bahai
Temples.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> The authority of all other Scriptures is
abrogated, even the "Bayan" of the Bab.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> The
"Kitab-ul-Akdas," the Most Holy Book, consists of
laws, exhortations, and warnings. The "Ikan,"
written by Baha before he set up his own claim,
is an attempt to show from previous books the truth
of the Bab's claims. The "Hidden Words," "Surat
al Haykal" (The human temple), the "Seven Valleys,"
the "Effulgences," the "Glad Tidings," etc.,
contain principles, precepts, and rhapsodies. There
are also the Epistles to the Kings and numerous
tablets (letters) to individual believers. Besides all
these, the discourses and letters of Abdul Baha, containing
interpretations and commands, are regarded
as revealed and inspired Words of God. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
collected in "Tablets of Abdul Baha," "Addresses
in Paris," "Addresses in London," "Some Answered
Questions," and in the <i>Star of the West</i>, newspaper.</p>

<p>IX. Bahaism abolishes the Christian institutions&mdash;the
Church, its sacraments, and its polity.</p>

<p>The Church must soon cease to have any meaning
for those who look for grace and strength to another
than "the head, even Christ" (Eph. iv. 15). Bahais
in America have already organized separate meetings
for worship in all places where they have a
score or more members. In Chicago, which is the
chief seat of the sect in America, they have 150 or
more members. I attended their regular Sunday
service, in a room which they have rented in the
Masonic Temple. About sixty were present, one-half
of whom were visitors like myself. The service
was modelled somewhat after the Protestant week-day
meeting, but without any prayer. Several hymns
were sung in praise and worship of Baha, from a
book specially written for his adoration. The leader,
a woman, read selections from the "Tablets of Abdul
Baha" and gave an exposition of Bahai teachings
and an invitation to faith in Baha and Abdul Baha,
as specially the fulfillment of the prophecies of the
Bible. Another woman read from the "Hidden
Words." The editor of the <i>Star</i>, one of six Bahai
men present, gave the announcements and said that
the meetings during the summer would be on the
ground, at Wilmette, where they expect to build the
temple (<i>Mashrak-ul-Azkar</i>). This temple is a darling
project of Abdul Baha. He dedicated the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
when he was in America and urges all believers to
build it quickly. He says: "The temple is the
greatest matter today for the upbuilding of the
cause."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> It will fulfill prophecy!</p>

<p>The government of Bahaism is to be by "Houses
of Justice." Each will be composed of nine or more
Bahai men elected by the people. Bahaism will be
the state religion. Kings will exist, but the politico-religious
hierarchy will perform many of the functions
of the state, even to settling international
disputes. Churches, assemblies, and conferences,
bishops and popes&mdash;all will be dispensed with. The
Bahai "houses" will conduct and control religion
for the world. The first universal vicegerent of God
is Abdul Baha. After him the supreme power will
be vested in the "house." Already signs of Bahai
tyranny are manifest. Abdul Baha declared that no
believer "must vary one hair's breadth from his
word." No Bahai may publish anything on religion
without first submitting it to him for censorship.
Such a command is made applicable to all Bahais.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
In the good time coming there will be a graduated
hierarchy&mdash;local, national, universal&mdash;who will bring
"all secular affairs under spiritual guidance."</p>

<p>With the Church and its ministry the "new revelation"
abolishes also the sacraments. Baptism is
no longer necessary, for "baptism by water," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Abdul Baha, "was a symbol of repentance and of
seeking forgiveness of sins. In the cycle of Baha
there is no longer need of this symbol, for its reality,
which is to be baptized with the Spirit and love of
God, is established."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Yet a substitute is at hand:<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>
"Thou hast asked regarding the naming of children.
Prepare a meeting, chant verses, supplicate guidance
for the babe; then give the name and enjoy beverages
and sweetmeats. This is spiritual baptism."
So Remey did. "I will make mention of a Bahai
christening [?] in Ferouzay [Persia]. We were
asked to name the baby. On the fifth day after the
child's birth a feast was spread. The baby was
brought out. Mr. Sprague gave the name Ruhullah;
prayers, tablets, and a hymn in praise of Baha
Ullah were chanted."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Such is the substitute for baptism
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The Lord's Supper as a remembrance of the sacrifice
of Christ is abolished. Instead of it there is
introduced an imitation, called the Unity Feast, with
traces of the Lord's Supper and of the <i>Agape</i>. Of
it Abdul Baha<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> says: "It must be inaugurated in
such a way as to resurrect the feast of the ancients,
namely, the Lord's Supper." We have descriptions
of it as celebrated by Abdul Baha in America and at
Acca.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> Sprague says: "The Master [at Acca] did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
not sit down with us, but served us, going from one
to another, heaping rice on our plates, bringing home
to us the words: 'Let him that is greatest among
you be your servant.' The Orientals could hardly
bear that their Master should wait on them. They
felt as Peter did when Christ washed his feet. After
the supper a tablet of Baha was chanted in Persian.
The supper was truly the Lord's Supper in all its
spiritual significance." Abdul Baha said that the
prophecy was fulfilled which said, "They shall come
from the east and the west and sit down in the kingdom
of God." In America Abdul Baha celebrated
the supper with each group of his followers. In his
absence a vacant seat is left at the head of the table
for the "master" and passages from the "Hidden
Words" are read as food is passed.</p>

<p>Other imitations of Christ's works and words are
repeated to keep up the pretense that He is the
Saviour. In Chicago and other places "the children
were on hand to receive the spiritual blessing of
Abdul Baha. He called each child to him and took
him in his lap. He blessed them all, laying his hand
in blessing on each little head." At a Unity Feast
he said: "Abdul Baha is standing and waiting upon
you." What is this but a copying of the words: "I
am among you as one that doth serve." Palpable
imitations of Christ's words abound in the so-called
Revelations. In the "Lawh-ul-Akdas "there is a
series of beatitudes as: "Blessed is the lowly one
who holds to the rope of my might. Blessed is the
hungry one who hastens away from desire. Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
is the thirsty one who seeks the nectar of my benediction.
Blessed is the spirit who was stirred by my
breath. Blessed is he who has suffered tribulation
for my name's sake," etc. Baha Ullah doubles the
number of Christ's Beatitudes! In the "Kitab-ul-Akdas,"
written many years before his death, Baha
imitates the parting words of Christ:</p>

<p>What palpable imitations of words so dear to the
Christian heart! Words which were in the mouth
of Christ Jesus the expression of deep and sincere
emotion are used for effect!</p>

<p>X. Bahaism is antichristian in its rites and ceremonies.</p>

<p>These regulations are, for the most part, copied
from the Moslem law and are prescribed in the
"Kitab-ul-Akdas." Ablution is commanded as a
religious rite, to be followed by sitting with one's face
towards the <i>Kibla</i> (Acca) and repeating <i>Alla hu Abha</i>
ninety-five times (5&times;19). As a Fast, Bahaism substitutes the
last month of their year, named Ala for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Ramazan. As Christians have Carnival week before
Lent, followed by Easter rejoicings, and as Moslems
have the Oruj Bayram, so Bahais have five
days of feasting before the Fast. This extends
through a Bahai month of nineteen days, March 2-20,
and is followed by the Noruz or Vernal Equinox.
Noruz is consecrated and its ceremonies prescribed
with religious sanctions as among the Nusaireyah.
The ordinance of fasting says: "Thus ordaineth the
Lord of men; abstain from eating and drinking from
dawn to sundown." This abstinence includes smoking
as among Moslems. The same exceptions are
made as in the Koran&mdash;that the traveller, the sick,
and pregnant and nursing women are excused.
Fasting is obligatory after the age of fifteen. The
Bab put the age limit at forty-two, but Baha enjoined
it as long as strength permits.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> The question naturally
arises if obligatory fasting is good, why reduce
the time from thirty to nineteen days: if reform is
the watchword, why not have the liberty of the
Gospel?</p>

<p>As in fasting, so in prayer Bahaism follows the
Moslem ceremonial law. Baha laid down a ritual
on the same lines. There are modifications, but
no essential difference, from Islam. In Islam devotion
is a strong point, formalism is its weakness.
Bahaism lessens the amount of devotion, without
getting rid of the prescribed formalism. Ablutions
are a necessary preliminary to the obligatory prayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
at least three times a day, but if one wishes to make
other prayers at night, he need not get out of bed to
perform the ablutions.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> "He who doth not find
water, must say five times, 'In the name of God,'"
etc. ("Akdas"). During the ablutions certain petitions
are prescribed as "while washing the hands,
say," etc.; "while washing the face, say," etc. Then
the worshipper must "stand facing the Holy Place"
(Acca) and say a portion of the prayers; then "bowing
down with hands on knees," say another portion;
then "standing with hands outstretched forward
and upward," another; then "sitting down,"
another portion. Each prayer has three prostrations
(<i>rika</i>). Prayer times are morning, afternoon, and
evening. Congregational prayer or at funerals was
abolished by Baha, but Abdul Baha permits it for
Americans.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Prayer is directed to Baha Ullah.
When the terms "God," "Lord," "Thy Greatest
Name" are used, Mirza Husain Ali is intended:
"He, Baha," says Abdul Baha<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> "is the dawning
place of Divinity and the manifestation of Divinity.
He is the ultimate goal, the adored one of all, and
the worshipped one of all." The editors add (the
capitals are theirs): "<i>Further than this</i> <span class="smcap">man has no
other point for concentration. He (Baha)
is God</span>, <i>the worshipped one of all</i>." Prayer, therefore,
is no longer to be in the name nor for the sake
of Jesus Christ but in the "Greatest Name," <i>i. e.</i>,
Baha Ullah's, "at the mention of which the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
before the Houris fall down," "the Name of Him
who is Ruler over what was and is."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> This name
is graven on the breastpins of Bahais, and as a
monogram on rings, with two stars alongside it, one
of which represents the Bab and the other Abdul
Baha. This charm is to be buried with the body.
A rosary of ninety-five beads is used daily by the
worshipper in saying the "Greatest name" 5&times;19
times. Allahu Abha is also to be said at the beginning
of a meal or of any business, or as a greeting,
just as the Moslems say, "Bism ullah" (In the name
of God) or "Peace be to you." The figure 9, the
sum of the letters of Baha, is also a talisman.</p>

<p>Pilgrimage is considered meritorious and has been
popular among American as well as Persian Bahais,
though Baha says:<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> "Visiting the tombs of the
dead is not necessary, it is better to give the money
to the House of Justice." The chief shrine is the
tomb of Baha Ullah and of the Bab<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> at Acca. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
have been published accounts of a score of American
women and of some men who have obtained permission
and entered, as it were, through "the gate
of heaven" and "paid their vows unto the Most
High." But not the least attraction was Abdul
Baha, "the king in his beauty." The pilgrim first
does obeisance to him. This is an ecstatic, hysteric
event. Mrs. True, "perfectly intoxicated with the
realization," kissed his hand.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Another lady sat at
his feet with her head on his knee. Another, when
she entered his presence, held out her arms, crying:
"My Lord, my Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> and rushing forward, fell on
her knees, sobbing.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Another narrative says<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> that
Abbas greeted them, "clasped each one in a loving
embrace," anointed each one with the attar of roses.
"Some of the believers kissed his hand." Of her
good-bye this lady says, "I held his hand a long
time." Even Mr. Horace Holley, author of "The
Modern Social Religion," writes,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> "This was he.
My whole body underwent a shock. My heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
leaped, my knees weakened, a thrill of acute receptive
feeling flowed from head to foot.... From
sheer happiness I wanted to cry." Another man,
L. G. Gregory, a negro, writes: "My knee bent
reverently before him." When Abdul Baha says:
"I am glad to see you," the pilgrims thrill at such
wondrous words! "His heavenly smile" gives
them happiness! His trite platitudes are written
down beside the midnight lamp, for the delectation
of similar dupes.</p>

<p>Next the pilgrims visit the Palace of Bahja and
the beautiful pleasure grounds where Baha resided
during most of his confinement at Acca, enjoying
much freedom and even luxury as a "prisoner."
The tomb of the Bab draws them, but more sacred
do they deem the tomb of Baha Ullah, "the culmination
of our pilgrimage." This shrine is in the Garden
of Bahja. Its outer court is adorned with beautiful
rugs, vases, chandeliers, and flowers. Here
they chant verses from the Tablets. Each pilgrim,
taking off his shoes, enters the "holy precincts"
alone. In this "holy of holies," "the heavenly
silence of that centre of peace," he "kneels and
prays at the throne of grace for pardon and help,"
"remembering the friends far away before the
presence." He counts it a "glorious experience at
once solemn and joyful." Coming out he is "served
with tea and given some beautiful roses which are
carefully preserved." Mrs. Grundy says that "they
remained all night at the tomb, chanting and praying
without intermission, and standing throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the ceremonies ... communing with the glorified
spirit of Baha Ullah." Under the arbour was a
chair where Baha Ullah used to sit. No one sits in
it any longer. She knelt at the foot of the chair
whilst one of the daughters of Baha chanted a
prayer.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>A shrine, deemed even more sacred, yet remains.
The pilgrims are conducted to it in an inner room of
the residence of Abdul Baha. Here are the images
"of the Glorious Ones of God." "We were all impelled
to remove our shoes before crossing the
threshold. Approaching in reverent awe, we were
anointed with a fragrant perfume, and as we knelt
before the majestic likeness<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> of the Blessed Perfection,
Baha Ullah and that of the Bab, we were unable
to speak."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> "Here is seen the expression of
gentleness, meekness, wisdom, light, love, majesty,
power, holiness, in short, every attribute of God."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>How far from the Christian position the Bahais
have wandered is seen in the narratives of these pilgrims
who take little interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="inset" style="width : 20em">
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">In those holy fields,</span><br />
Over whose acres walked those blessed feet<br />
Which, nineteen hundred years ago, were nail'd<br />
For our advantage to the blessed cross.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>To them not Jerusalem but Acca is the Holy City.
Not Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee, but Haifa and
its bay, not the Garden of Gethsemane but the
Rizwan, not Calvary but the Turkish prison barracks,
not Mount Olivet but Mount Carmel, attract
their interest and engage their love.</p>

<p>XI. Bahaism in its festivals abandons the Christian
year. In the "Akdas," besides <i>Noruz</i>, New Year,
there are two sacred days: (1) The anniversary of
the declaration of the Bab, May 23, 1844; and (2) the
birthday of Baha Ullah, November 12, 1817. To
these have been added: (3) The feast of <i>Rizwan</i>,
April 21-May 2, commemorating the declaration of
Baha Ullah in Bagdad; (4) the death of Baha Ullah,
May 28, 1892, at Acca; and still later (5) the birthday
of Abdul Baha, May 24, 1844; and (6) his appointment
as "Centre of the Covenant," November
26. The four or five intercalary days, February
26-March 2, corresponding in a measure to Carnival,
are a feasting time before the annual fast.</p>

<p>The weekly holy days of the three monotheistic
religions are abolished. Instead of a Sabbath, every
nineteenth day, the first of each month, is a sacred
day; even the week is abolished. The ninth day of
each month has been made sacred by Abdul Baha.</p>

<p>The era is also changed. The world and its
events are to be reckoned from the Bahai cycle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Just what this is seems to be doubtful, for some date
from the Declaration of the Bab and write 1914 as
the year 70. The <i>Star of the West</i> is so dated.
Some date from the birth of Baha Ullah and count
this as the year 97, as on the title page of "The
Bahai Movement," by Remey. Even the year of
Abdul Baha's accession (1892) is used as a date.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
Thus Bahaism has no Christian era, no Christian
Sabbath, no Easter, no Christmas, no Trinitarian
formula in benediction, doxology, or sacrament, no
symbol of the cross, no hymns to Christ, no Apostles'
Creed, no Lord's Prayer. Yet it claims to be Christian!</p>

<p>XII. In conclusion, Bahaism is antichristian in its
aim and propaganda. Whenever it comes in contact
with Christian missions, in Persia, Syria, Egypt, India,
or Burmah, it is the opposer of the messenger
of Christ and His Gospel. A hope cherished thirty
years ago, by some missionaries and others, that it
might be a stepping stone for Moslems to Christ
has not been fulfilled; albeit some of the best converts
from Islam have first sought the broken cisterns
of Bahaism.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Bahaism is plainly antichristian. It
is a new and a different, an inferior and a false religion. Its claims are contradictory to the claims of<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
Christ. It would draw men's allegiance to another
person, to other Scriptures, to a system of doctrine
and way of salvation inconsistent with the Gospel,
to forms of worship, ceremonies, and festivals at
variance with those of Christianity. It declares that
Christianity is abrogated and superseded. Its erroneous
dictum is that "the revelation of Jesus is no
longer the point of guidance for the world." Why
cannot Christian people see that its claims annul
faith and loyalty to Christ? Surely giving Bahaism
countenance, assistance, and encouragement or opportunity
for its propaganda is to wound Christ in
the house of His friends.</p>

to the dogs. It was rescued, taken to Teheran and interred. After many
years it was secretly transferred to Acca. The Bab's house in Shiraz was
first of all a shrine, and pilgrimage to it is enjoined in the "Akdas." Another
is the mausoleum over the grave of the martyrs at Teheran. Similarly
at Ispahan ("A Year Among the Persians," p. 13). Abdul Baha
seems to desire to increase reverence for shrines and inculcates such
honour for the martyrs as will soon develop into superstition. In the
"Visiting Tablets for Martyrs," he says (pp. 9-12): "Blessed is the one
who attains to visit thy grave. Blessed is the forehead that is set against
thy tomb. Blessed is the person who lights a lamp at thy resting-place."
"I beg God to make thy sepulchre a mine of mercy, a depository of gifts,
and to encompass it with manifold signs." A chant for the pilgrim begins:
"O peerless martyr! Verily I salute thy pure dust and thy holy
blessed tomb. The everlasting abode is for such as visit thy tomb."</p></div>

He said to Abbas Effendi, "An American woman has stated that she came
to Haifa and when she entered your room she felt that she was in the
presence of the very Son of God, the Christ, and that she held out her
arms, crying, 'My Lord, my Lord,' and rushed to you, kneeling at your
blessed feet sobbing like a child. Can this be right to accept worship?"
"I left Abbas Effendi with the painful feeling that he was accepting divine
honour from simple-minded women from America and receiving their
gifts of gold without protest or rebuke."</p></div>

encourage them? Ignorant devotion has so soon degenerated into superstition

Baha writes: "I have received news that some one in Persia has imitated

<p class="h2">Bahaism and the State</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>Bahaism certainly does contemplate an earthly dominion which
shall eventually subvert all existing governments.&mdash;<i>Doctor Holmes
in Speer's "Missions and Modern History," Vol. I, p. 129.</i></p>

<p>The supreme manifestation of social morality is always government
and in formulating a politic, Baha Ullah most clearly earned
our reverence as the prophet of modern society.... Democracy
alone tends to vulgarize personal values, as the United States
proves. By uniting the aristocratic spirit with the democratic form
of Government, he insured a politic at once equable and effective.&mdash;<i>H.
Holley, "The Modern Social Religion" p. 203.</i></p>

<p>In calling Babi-Bahaism a worse cult than Mormonism, I do so
deliberately.&mdash;<i>S. K. Vatralsky in "Amer. Jour. of Theology,"

<p>There can be little doubt from the intolerance they show to those
who recant, that should they gain power enough they would be as
ready to persecute Christians as was Mohammed to put to death
the Jews of Medina.&mdash;<i>Dr. G. W. Holmes in Speer's ibid., p. 130.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">BAHAISM,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> as a new religion bidding for
popular favour, should be considered in its
relation to the State, for this is an important
factor in forming our judgment of it. As it historically
sprang from Babism, it is well to review, first
of all, the political relations of Babism.</p>

<p>I. Babism in Persia was a form of Mahdiism.
Mirza Ali Mohammed, the Bab, claimed to be the
Mahdi, the Kaim, the twelfth Imam returned. According
to Shiah doctrine, the rulership of the State
by divine law belongs to the Imam. The Kajar
Shahs had the right to kingship only in the absence
of the Imam. Their authority would cease with his
appearance. This is so universally recognized that
the constitution of Persia drawn up by the Parliament
in 1906-1907 contains in the preamble the
provision that it shall continue only till the manifestation
of the Imam.</p>

<p>In accordance with this principle the Babis looked
upon Mohammed Shah and Nasr-ud-Din Shah as no
longer the rightful rulers. They were, <i>ipso facto</i>,
supplanted by the Bab, the Sahib-i-Zaman or Lord
of the Age. The Kajars were called by them "un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>lawful kings." Hazrat-Kuddus says,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> "We are the
rightful rulers; know that Nasr-ud-Din is no true
king and that such as support him shall be tormented
in hell-fire." Disloyalty was an essential corollary
of Babism and not a consequence of the repression
and persecution which it met. The measures of the
Persian Government were caused by this knowledge.
The rebellions of the Babis were justified in their
eyes by self-preservation as well as by the desire to
remove, if possible, the Shah and make way for the
reign of the Bab. Professor Browne's opinion on
these points is conclusive. He says:<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Babis looked for their immediate triumph
over all existing powers, culminating in the universal
establishment of the true faith and the reign of God's
saints on earth.... They intended to inherit
the earth; they held those who rejected the Bab as
unclean and worthy of death, and they held the
Kajar Shahs in a detestation which they were at no
pains to hide.... They did not make any
profession of loyalty to or love for the reigning
dynasty.... Unbelievers were flouted with
scorn because they supposed that the Promised
Deliverer would confirm the authority of the
Shahs."</p>

<p>The "Bayan," the chief book of the Bab, anticipates
the time when the Shah's government shall be
superseded by a Babi state, which shall prevail in
Persia. It gives the laws for this Babi state as well
as regulations for the distribution of the spoils of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and for the Jahad,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> showing that the Bab anticipated
religious wars. The kings of the Bayanic dispensation
are directed what they should do. In the five
chief provinces of Persia, no unbelievers are to be
allowed to live, except some foreign Christian merchants.
They are not to be killed, but to be driven
out and their property confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Directions are
given as to the use of their property. The strongly
intolerant doctrine is set forth<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> that "unbelievers
have no right to anything, not even to a believing
wife. All that thou seest in the hands of unbelievers
is not theirs by right. If the manifestation has
power, he would even forbid their breathing."</p>

<p>Babism, therefore, was a political as well as a religious
movement. As such it fought and with some
prospect of success, for, as Browne says, "it seemed at
one time to menace the supremacy alike of the Kajar
dynasty and of the Mohammedan faith in Persia."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>The Bab was executed in 1850. The Babi insurrections
were suppressed. Terrible reprisals followed
the attempt on the life of Nasr-ud-Din Shah. The
leaders fled into exile to Turkey. Babism, repressed
and forced into concealment, entered upon a new
phase. It emerged somewhat changed as Bahaism
(1867).</p>

<p>II. Bahaism should be considered in its political
aspects in relation to the Government of Persia.</p>

<p>(a) In Persia, the issue of the sword had declared
against the Babis. Baha Ullah adopted a policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
aptly called "political opportunism."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> He proclaimed
the loyalty of himself and his followers to
the Shah, denounced the attempted assassinations,
wrote prayers to be said for the Shah,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> and pleaded
for the toleration of the sect as one without political
aspirations. Bahai apologists condemned the Bab
and the conduct of the Babis, declaring it contrary
to the principles of the Bab.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> Mirza Abul Fazl, on
trial before the Persian Government, repudiated the
Babis, denounced their actions as unseemly and bad,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>
and declared with emphasis that Bahaism was an
entirely different religion. He pronounced the Shah
free from blame regarding the death of the Bab<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> and
the persecutions of the Babis, casting the responsibility
and reproach on the mullahs and the Ministers of
State.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> He even made a show of blaming the attendants
for the death of Badi, the messenger who
bore Baha's epistle to the Shah, and made as though
the Shah regretted it. The "New History" and the
"Traveller's Narrative" are both tendency writings,
following out the same purpose, glossing over the
facts as given in the contemporary narrative of Mirza
Jani, putting the odium on the mullahs and asserting
"that no particular blame attaches to His Most
Sacred Majesty the Shah";<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> though other writings
of Baha show a spirit of hostility to the Shah.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a>
Following the policy of conciliation the Bahais made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>petition to the Shah stating that<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> "this sect has no
worldly object nor any concern with political matters,
it has nothing to do with affairs of Government
neither has it any concern with the powers of the
throne." They stated that<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> "they have made no
disturbance, or rebellions, or any sign of sedition."
So Baha<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> enjoined that "in every country they
must behave towards the Government with faithfulness,
trustfulness, and truthfulness." The Persian
Government responded to this policy and ceased
to persecute as before. During the past fifty years
the Bahais have not been much molested. Their
persecutions have been few and generally due to
local causes. The number of Bahais who have lost
their lives in the course of their history (after they
cease to be Babis) is probably not more than 300,
more than half of whom were killed in riots at
Ispahan and Yezd in 1903. The Bahai historian<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>
states that "on rare occasions certain Ulema, for their
own personal and private advantage, molest one or
two individuals of the sect." But the Shah's Government
has tolerated them.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Not counting the present
Holy War against the Christians, more have been
killed in Persia in the half century than Bahais.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> The
Government has shown liberality towards Bahais by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
allowing them to occupy positions in the civil service,
as clerks in the post, telegraph, customs, courts, and
consulates, and has not discriminated against them.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Coming to the period of the agitation for a
constitution and the revolution, it is plain that the
Bahais had little to do with the struggle. Neither
they nor their teachings were the cause of it. The
causes were the same, in general, as those which influenced
Turkey and China towards constitutional
reform. The occasions in local circumstances and
politics had nothing to do with Bahaism. The
leaders were enlightened Moslems, and even mullahs
of the Shiahs. They were not Bahais. These held
aloof from the propaganda and the struggle for
popular liberties, took little part in the elections or
in parliament, and joined neither the army of the
constitutionalists nor that of the reactionaries. They
displayed no love of country by striving for the cause
of the people, nor any real love or loyalty to the
autocratic Shah. Yet the influence of Abdul-Baha
Abbas was thrown in favour of Mohammed Ali Shah,
and after he had scattered parliament at the cannon's
mouth and annulled the constitution, Bahais were
granted appointments in the civil service and rejoiced
in the reactionary r&eacute;gime. A tablet of Abdul
Baha was circulated prophesying a long and prosperous
reign for Mohammed Ali Shah, who before
many months was driven from his throne into exile.</p>

<p>My personal knowledge of these circumstances is
supported by abundant printed evidence. First of
all there is Abdul Baha's own statement. He said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in America,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> "In Persia the Bahais have no part in
the movements which have terminated in corruption.
They must have nothing to do with seditious movements."
Excerpts from his letters<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> show that they
were constantly enjoined "from the very beginning
of the revolution to stand aside from the struggle
and war." To the same effect are the words of the
Bahai Remey,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> "The Bahais had remained neutral
in the struggle for constitutional liberty and the renewal
of Persia." So Dreyfus, another Bahai,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> "He
(Abdul Baha) dissuaded them from mixing themselves
up in the political struggle. This explains the
apparently passive r&ocirc;le played by the Bahais in contemporary
events in Persia." Because of this attitude,
Professor Browne accuses them of lack of patriotism
and laments their inaction. But this attitude
of neutrality was only maintained by them as far as
taking up arms and public action were concerned.
Their secret influence was on the side of the reactionary
party. It is plain that the constitutionalists regarded
the Bahais as their opponents, and Mohammed
Ali Shah counted them as his supporters. Abdul
Baha said in New York,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> "The Bahais have taken
no part whatever in political questions and disturbances.
Their clamorous persecutors were the revolutionists.
These discontents wanted constitutional
rights and privileges. They were politicians, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
religionists." Certainly the hostile animus of these
words is unmistakable. There is indubitable proof,
too, that Abdul Baha carried on correspondence with
Mohammed Ali Shah. M. H. Ford, a Bahai writer,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>
states the fact in detail. Its purport was such that,
when the Constitutionalists knew it, Abdul Baha
feared violence. This was commonly reported in
Persia. In Chicago the first Bahai missionary to
America confirmed this fact which he had heard from
Acca. He said, "The authorities intercepted Abbas's
letter intriguing with Mohammed Ali Shah, and
therefore the revolutionists threatened him." Remey
shows the affiliation of the Bahais with the Shah,
and his satisfaction with them. He arrived at Teheran
just when the Shah had scattered the parliament
and hanged the editors. He says, "We found
the Bahais in the utmost peace and happiness. They
were in good esteem and respect of the [reactionary]
Government, and were now enjoying <i>unusual</i> privileges....
Several of the Bahais had been appointed
to high governmental positions." In accord
with all these facts is the statement of J. D.
Frame, M. D., of Resht:</p>

<p>"The political influence of the Bahais has been
grossly exaggerated. They were forbidden to accept
seats in the first parliament and professed to
maintain strict neutrality, but in the spring of 1908 a
'tablet' was circulated among them, promising that
Mohammed Ali Shah would rule for the remainder
of his life; and the writer possesses a copy of another 'tablet' promising him speedy peace and prosperity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
The subsequent forced abdication of the
king cost the Bahais considerable prestige and some
followers."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>We thus see a double failure on the part of this
movement. As Babism it failed in 1848-1852 in its
rebellion and wars against the Kajars; as Bahaism
it failed to enter into and assist the modern movement,
which, aiming at reform and progress, inaugurated
a constitution. The cause of the latter is not
far to seek; Bahaism has a political scheme of its
own. We will now consider it.</p>

<p>III. Bahaism has set forth a system of civil government.
Claiming to be a revelation from God, it
has enunciated the laws and regulations of the future
State. It approves of constitutional monarchy as
the best form of government, and permits republics.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
But this monarchy will be limited not so much by its
constitution as by the law of Bahaism and its hierarchy.
Baha, in the "Kitab-ul-Akdas," the Book of
Laws, directs that Bet-Adl, houses of justice, be established
in every place, with nine or more members,
all Bahai men, who shall be Trustees of the Merciful,
Administrators for God. In the thirteenth of the
"Glad Tidings"<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> he says:</p>

<p>"The affairs of the people are placed in charge of
the men of the House of Justice. They are daysprings
of command (divine agents, representatives
of God). They may execute what they deem advisable.
It is incumbent upon all to obey them. Their</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p><p>souls will be inspired with divine aspiration. God
will inspire them with what He willeth."</p>

<p>With them will lie the interpretation of points of
doctrine. They must decree and judge according to
Bahai revelation. "They must gaze day and night
towards that which hath been revealed from the
horizon of the Supreme Pen." They shall rule by
divine right. Their authority shall be absolute.
Abdul Baha restates the words of Baha:<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> "The
House of Justice must be obeyed in all things." "It
is the centre of true government." "The Law of
God will be invested in them, and they will render
decisions." "All judgment will be from the standpoint
of God's laws." "Its decisions and commands
will be guarded from mistake. It will have
conferred upon it infallibility." The House of Justice
will have local councils, national ones, and an international
one.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Of the latter, Abdul Baha said in
an address in New York:</p>

<p>"A universal or world House of Justice shall be
organized. That which it orders shall be the Truth
in explaining the commands of Baha Ullah and shall
be obeyed by all. <i>All men shall be under its supervision.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>Its functions are not confined to matters of faith, for
Abdul Baha continues: "The House of Justice is endowed
with a political as well as a religious aspect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
It embodies both aspects, and is protected by the
preserving power of Baha Ullah himself." <i>In the
political aspect it will be supreme.</i> "The separation
of the Religion and the State can only be temporary,"
says Dreyfus,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> "a momentary stage. For the
present the two spheres are separate. When Bahaism
triumphs they will be united." "The House of
Justice<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> will have under its control almost the whole
administration, and naturally will take the place of
our municipal councils. Such has been Baha Ullah's
intention. Further he clearly aims not only at a
municipal House of Justice, but also at a legislative
one, sitting as a national parliament and as an international
tribunal." Remember that all the members
are to be Bahais. So Remey says, "There will be a
union of Religion and the State&mdash;the governments
of the nations. The material laws of men will be
founded and enforced according to Bahaism."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> In
this politico-religious r&eacute;gime, the political will be
subject to the religious. "The kings and rulers of
the world," says Abdul Baha,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> "will find their true
authority under the rulings of the House of Justice.
It will decide between kings and kings." Baha addressed
letters<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> to kings with arrogant assumption of
authority to control the civil powers.</p>

<p>The Houses of Justice will have <i>large financial
powers</i>. They shall inherit all property of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
dying without heirs, and one-third of that of those
dying childless.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> One-third of all fines for crimes
shall go to them. For example, in case of murder,
two-thirds of the blood money shall go to the family
of the murdered and one-third to the House of Justice.
A tithe of nineteen-hundredths shall be given
into their hands. They shall act as trustees for
minors and incapables, and as a Poor Board.</p>

<p>They shall have <i>civil</i> jurisdiction, "to settle
material difficulties between believers,"<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> for the protection
of men, for the preservation of human
honour.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> "If any man refuses to educate his children,
the House of Justice shall do it at his expense,"
and "shall order all the negligent to pay" and use
police powers to enforce it.</p>

<p>They must also interpret and administer <i>criminal</i>
law, for Baha has "revealed" a code of laws and
regulations concerning material as well as spiritual
things.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> Abdul Baha says, "The revelations of
Baha Ullah contain all the great laws of social government."
"The laws cover all points and questions of
national administration."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> For example, in the
"Kitab-ul-Akdas," the punishment for theft is prescribed:
for the first offense, exile; for the second,
imprisonment; for the third, branding "thief" on the
forehead, "lest other countries accept him." For
adultery a fine is to be paid to the House of Justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and for the second offense, double of the fine.
Arson is made punishable by burning, etc. This fiat
legislation of Baha Ullah is to be imposed upon the
parliaments of all nations. "All legislative and administrative
functions," says Dreyfus,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> "shall assume
a sacred character" under the control of the Bahai
House of Justice.</p>

<p>In brief, Bahaism would set up in each town, in
every country, ruling councils, and a central one
universal in its sway, composed entirely of Bahais,
clothed with supreme authority, because God-given,
over kings, parliaments, and peoples; councils infallible
and absolute, superior to appeal or protest;
deciding and exacting obedience in every department
of the life of humanity&mdash;religious, domestic,
social, educational, financial, judicial, and political.
It would be not an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, but an Empire
over all. It would be a priestcraft<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> such as the
world has not yet seen&mdash;a religious-political r&eacute;gime
in which kings and presidents will go not to Canossa
but to Acca, and alike hold the stirrups of Bahai
justices, and laws of parliaments will be subject to
revision and veto by the Bahai House. In it is the
certainty of priestly oppression when fallible men set
up their judgment as God's. The Bahais claim to
have no priests and no <i>hierarchy</i>. It is a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of names. Their system and laws contain the real
thing, full-fledged, men mediating God's will. We
may call it a <i>bahaiarchy</i>, if they prefer.</p>

<p>Abdul Baha, recognizing the objections that will
be made to the political functions of the Bahai justices,
and foreseeing difficulty with Governments,
has, for the time being, directed that in America and
Europe the name "House of Spirituality" or "House
of Consultation" be used.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> But change of name
does not alter the reality or change the "revelation"
of Baha. The House of Justice (central) is to be set
up when Abdul Baha dies, and it will assume its
functions gradually as opportunity and expediency
demand. Already orders have gone forth prohibiting
the interpretation of the words of Baha or personal
expositions of them.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Already the fiat has
interdicted the publication, by a Bahai, of a tract,
book, or translation on the Bahai religion without
submitting it to the censor at Acca.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></p>

<p>The effect of the working of the Bahai system may
be realized by imagining it as set up in Persia.
Suppose, for example, that the small minority of
Bahais now in Persia should become a majority,
with a Bahai Shah, Bahaism would become the
established religion. "Houses of Justice" would
come into operation. What of those who remain
Moslems and Christians? Fortunately Baha has
abolished the law of the Bab that required their expulsion
from the chief provinces of Persia and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
confiscation of their property. But either the other
religions must be judged by Bahai courts, or separate
courts must be set up for them. This would perpetuate
the double system of courts, the <i>urfi</i> or civil
and the <i>shari</i> or religio-civil courts. The latter
would be entirely Bahai and either lording it over or
in conflict with the civil administration. This would
be a continuation of the present confusion of Persian
conditions, only with the Bahais in control. What
might the minority expect? The oppressions and
anathemas received by the old Bahais from the followers
of Abdul Baha Abbas give the answer.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Fortunately
for the world, the universal reign of Bahaism
is not to be realized, neither is the prophecy of Abdul
Baha to be fulfilled which says<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> "that the flag of
Baha Ullah will overcome every other flag and all
rulers will do homage to it."</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class="h2">Bahaism and Woman</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Baha Ullah in a letter to one of his wives:&mdash;This writing is to
the Exalted Leaf, who hath tasted My Most Holy and Wonderful
Saliva. We have given thee to drink from My Sweetest Mouth, O
thou blessed and sparkling leaf. We have bestowed upon thee
such a station as no woman had who preceded thee.&mdash;<i>In Prayers,
Tablets and Instructions, 1900.</i></p>

<p>There is a touch of oriental luxury of admiration in some estimates
of Kurrat-ul-Ayn, who in important moral characteristics did
not rise above the level of her time and place. And in its results
Babism has not exalted woman.&mdash;<i>R. E. Speer, "Missions and
Modern History" Vol. I, p. 150.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">ABDUL BAHA while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> in Europe and America
had much to say about the relation of man
and woman. In New York City, after referring
the audience to various books of the Bahai
religion, he said: "Similarly all the other tablets of
Baha Ullah contain <i>new</i> teachings, which have not
been revealed in any books of the past Prophets.
The sixth new teaching is the equality between men
and women. This is peculiar to the teachings of
Baha Ullah, for all other religions placed men above
women."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> In the exposition of Bahai teachings at
Clifton, England, he declared: "His Highness,
Baha Ullah, established certain precepts or principles."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a>
"The sixth principle of Baha Ullah regards
the equality of the sexes. God has created
the man and the woman equal. In the animal kingdom
the male and the female enjoy suffrage
[laughter]; in the vegetable kingdom the plants all
enjoy equal suffrage [laughter and applause]. The
male and the female of the human kingdom are
equal before God. Divine justice demands that men
and women have equal rights."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>My first thought on reading these statements was
one of surprise, for they contradict my observations
during thirty years' residence in Persia, in close touch
with Bahais. I decided to make a thorough investigation
of the teachings and practice of Baha Ullah
bearing on the relation of the sexes, to determine definitely
whether these claims of the "inspired interpreter"
were valid or not. A considerable body of
Bahai literature and "revelation" is accessible.
Examination of the chief books, the "Kitab-ul-Akdas,"
the "Ikan" and the "Surat-ul-Haykal" disclose no
such teaching. Neither the 155 paragraphs of the
"Hidden Words," nor the "Seven Valleys" have any
such delectable thoughts for Oriental women.
Neither the six "Ornaments"<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> of the faith nor the
four "Rays,"<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> nor the nine "Effulgences,"<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> nor the
eleven "Leaves of the Words of Paradise," nor the
nine precepts of the "Tablet of the World," nor the
fifteen "Glad Tidings"&mdash;though they announce
many blessings, from freedom to cut the beard as
you please to constitutional monarchy as the best
form of government&mdash;give the teaching of the
equality of woman with man. Neither Mirza Abul
Fazl in his "Bahai Proofs," representing the
new Bahais of Abdul Baha, nor Doctor Kheiralla
in his ponderous volume on Beha Ullah, representing
the old Behais, in this bitter and rancorous
schism; nor Myron Phelps in his "Life of
Abbas Effendi," nor Professor Browne of Cambridge
University in his learned and impartial investigations regarding the religion makes the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that Baha Ullah teaches the equality of man and
woman. On the contrary, investigation confirmed
my previous conviction that the position of woman
under Bahai laws and customs is inferior to that she
holds in Western lands and that her lot is far less
desirable and less blest than in Christian civilization.
I reached the conclusion that this doctrine as enunciated
by the "Interpreter" is a late addition to
Bahaism, intended to attract the attention and tickle
the ears of audiences in Europe and America.</p>

<p>Of the two or three thousand Americans who are
following the cult of Bahaism, most are women.
Concerning this Abdul Baha says in a tablet: "Today
the women of the West lead the men in the
service of the cause (Bahaism) and loosen their
tongues in eloquent lectures."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> The editor adds,
"Nine-tenths of the active workers in the cause are
women."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Hence it is timely to consider the teaching
and practice of Baha Ullah with regard to
women.</p>

<p>I. I will first take up the <i>subject of education</i>, for
in regard to it the law of Bahaism justifies, theoretically,
their boast of maintaining the equality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sexes. In this it is, however, simply imitating the
law of enlightened Christian lands, nor does their
practice at all keep pace with their precepts. In the
seventh Ishrak (Effulgence) it is "enjoined upon all
to instruct and educate their children."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> The "Kitab-ul-Akdas"
decrees "that every father must educate
his sons and daughters in learning and in writing"
and also in the Bahai religion. Education is to be
compulsory and if neglected by the parents must be
attended to by the "House of Justice." But, notwithstanding
this law, most Persian Bahais have allowed
their girls to grow up in ignorance, while educating
many of their boys. Even at Acca,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Syria, the headquarters
of the sect, where Baha had a school for
boys, no like opportunity was furnished to the girls
for an education. The fact that modern schools
for girls could not be opened in Persia is no adequate
excuse, for private tutors could have been employed,
as is the custom in many Persian Shiah
families, or the fathers could at least have taught
their daughters to read. Lately American Bahais
have begun to stir them up. They have organized
the Persian-American or Orient-Occident Educational
Society. It raises funds in America for Bahai schools
and hospitals. With exceeding lack of candour, it
poses as simply a philanthropic enterprise and conceals
its primary and ulterior object, which is the
propagation of Bahaism. Its missionaries make
their reports of their work in the <i>Bahai News</i> or
<i>Star of the West</i>, of Chicago. They have one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
more schools for girls in Persia and several scores of
girls in attendance. The American Bahai missionaries
are residing in Teheran and Tabriz,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> directing
the propaganda and working for the elevation of the
girls and women through the Bahai religion.</p>

<p>II. I pass to the consideration of <i>the civil and domestic
rights of woman under Bahaism</i>, and will review
the customs and regulations regarding marriage&mdash;so
fundamental in the constitution of human society.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Marriage seems to be obligatory, according
to the "Kitab-ul-Akdas." It says: "A solitary life
does not meet God's approval; adhere unto what
the trustworthy Counsellor commands. Deprive not
yourselves of that which is created for you."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> Monks
and nuns are called upon to marry that they may
have children "to celebrate the praise of God." A
tablet says: "Nor must they refrain from marriage
which causes procreation and multiplication of the
servants of God."<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> Mirza Abul Fazl, the learned
philosopher of the dispensation, interprets the law to
mean: "He has enjoined upon the people of Baha
abstinence from monkhood as well as from ascetic
discipline. He has commanded them to marry."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
Professor Browne says: "Marriage is enjoined upon
all." In like manner the "Bayan" of the Bab previously
made marriage obligatory, but unlawful with
an unbeliever.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Marriage is declared to be conditioned on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
consent of both parties and of the parents. But in
practice the matter of consent is still one-sided.
Take, for example, an incident in the life of Abbas
Effendi.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> The mother and sister were very desirous
that he should marry and looked about and found a
girl of whom they approved. The sister narrates
that "without consulting my brother, I invited the
girl to visit us. After a wearisome journey, she and
her brother reached Haifa. We commenced quietly
to make preparations for the marriage without making
known to my brother the arrival of the girl.
My brother saw that there was something unusual
afoot, so he demanded of us with considerable
energy, 'What is this? What are all the people
smiling about? Are you again planning to get me
a wife? If you are, give it up; I will not marry.'
We pleaded and reasoned with him. At length we
said, 'She has come, what shall we do?' He hesitated
and finally said: 'Well, since you have brought
her here, she belongs to me, and I will give her in
marriage to some one else.' At length my brother
brought about her marriage to a husband of his own
selection." The "consent" of the girl in this case
seems to have been considered about as much as in
ordinary Oriental usage.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Baha Ullah advised against child-marriages,
yet, strange to say, seems to have tolerated child-betrothals.
Among Persians it is a common custom
to betroth children. Abbas was after this manner
betrothed to his cousin in infancy. When the household of Baha thought the time had come for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
marriage, Abbas thought differently and refused to
agree to it. This incident<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> occurred before the one
narrated above and is concerning a different girl.
Curiously it was a girl named Moneera, who had
been betrothed to another in infancy who finally became
the wife of Abbas Effendi. She had been
promised to her cousin Mohammed Tagi, and after
she had reached the age of maturity, the youth
urged on the marriage. The wedding was celebrated
and the bride brought to the groom's house.
Then, so the story goes, the husband refused to see
his bride and continued in stubborn neglect and
denial of marital rights till his death&mdash;six months
afterwards. Later Baha Ullah persuaded Abbas to
take the "sweet and amiable" virgin-widow for his
wife and he is said to have attained to "a warm
affection and regard" for the woman he was asked
to marry.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> Did I wish to assume the r&ocirc;le of higher
critic, I might suggest that the latter incident, like
that in "When Knighthood was in Flower," is
apocryphal, and intended to create a legend of her
virginity up to the time she became the "leaf" of
the "Greatest Branch of God."</p>

<p>Another account I have gathered from a Syrian
disciple of Baha. He reports that Abbas Effendi
would not marry the girl his parents had betrothed
him to, because he had a love affair with Moneera,
the wife of Mohammed Tagi. The speedy demise
of the husband was attributed to poison administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
by his wife, who thereupon became the wife of Abbas
Effendi. Her title among Bahais is "Holy Mother."</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Another part of the marriage law gives directions
as to the number of wives a man may take.
The "Kitab-ul-Akdas" says: "God hath decreed
you to marry. Beware of marrying more than two,
and whosoever is content with one, attaineth peace
for himself and her."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>Mr. Phelps<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> calls attention to this fact that the
Book of Laws permits of taking two wives. This
limitation of the man to bigamy is deemed an improvement
on the law of Islam allowing polygamy.</p>

<p>But Bahai law does not permit a wife to have two
husbands. This absolutely invalidates the claim and
declaration of Bahaism concerning the equality of
the sexes. It proclaims the woman the inferior, not
the equal. No equality can exist in a household under
such a license. Where is the boast of progress
and superiority, when the most essential unit of human
society is nullified? "Twain shall be one,"
says the Gospel of Christ. Can we believe that the
"Incarnated Father of all" has revealed a new
"Most Holy Book" in which bigamy is permitted?
<i>Akstag fur Allah!</i> God forbid!</p>

<p>I will now give some details from the history of
the Babi and Bahai "Manifestations" to show their
practice in regard to marriage.</p>

<p>After the execution of the Bab, 1850, the rival
claimants to prophethood were Mirza Yahya, surnamed Subh-i-Azal, and Mirza Husain Ali, surnamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Baha Ullah. They were sons of Mirza Abbas of
Nur,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> called Mirza Buzurk. He had a wife and a
concubine. Yahya was the son of the wife and
Husain Ali of the concubine. This was under the
law of Islam. The subsequent enmity of the half-brothers
exhibits one of the evil results of polygamy.</p>

<p>Subh-i-Azal was the "Lord of two wives," whose
names and condition are recorded in the pension
records<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> of the Turkish and British Governments in
Cyprus. The first was named Fatima and her companion
wife was Rukayya. They had fourteen children.
Besides the two, who were with Azal in
Cyprus, it seems there were two others. Of the
third wife he says<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> in his personal narrative: "My
wife, who was taken captive and was released, has
now grown old in Persia without an interview being
possible." The fourth quarrelled with her lord and
accompanied the Bahais to Acca.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> After several of
the Azalis, with whom she was living, were murdered
by the Bahais,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> she was sent on to Constantinople
with a surviving Azali.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>Baha Ullah, like Mohammed, surpassed his own
law. He had three wives, or two wives and a concubine.
Bahai writers generally omit this information
in describing his life and character. Kheiralla
has a chapter on his household and gives the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and titles of his children, twelve in all, but fails to
mention the fact that he had two wives, though he
says: "Like Abraham, by establishing his household,
Baha Ullah perfected the laws of man, and fulfilled
the prophecies of scripture."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> C. M. Remey
passes over the subject with the remark: "As a man
he lived a life in harmony with his Oriental environment."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>
Abbas Effendi in his "Traveller's Narrative,"
Abul Fazl, Dreyfus, Sprague, Thornton and
others fail to inform their readers of the truth and
this omission is evidently with definite purpose.
Phelps is more candid. He says that "Baha Ullah
had two wives; that the Book of Laws permits it."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a>
Professor Browne refers to the three, giving the honorary
titles conferred upon two of them. He makes
a quotation<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> from Hasht Behasht which reads:
"Among the titles conferred by Baha Ullah are the
following:&mdash;on his wives, Madh-i-Ulya, 'the Supreme
Cradle,' and Varaka-i-Ulya, 'the Supreme
Leaf.'" And in the "New History," he says: "The
title of Varaka-i-Ulya was conferred by Baha Ullah
on one of his wives."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> The name of the first wife
was Aseyeh or Nowab. She was the mother of
Abbas Effendi and six other children.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> According
to Subh-i-Azal's narrative<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> she was a niece of the
Shah's vizier. She survived Baha and suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
much from the children of the other wife, according
to Abbas Effendi.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> The first marriage was in
Teheran in 1835. He took a "companion for her"
in 1850. Her title was Madh-Ulya. She was the
mother of Mirza Mohammed Ali, Mirza Badi Ullah
and other sons and daughters. The manuscript,
"Life of Baha Ullah," continues: "In the last year
at Bagdad (1867-68) before the exiling of our Lord
to Constantinople, the sister of Mirza Mahdi of
Kashan was honoured to be His wife." It appears
that she was sent by a rich believer from Persia to
be a maid-servant in Baha's household. The Persian
Consul in Bagdad, Mirza Buzurk Khan Kasvini<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>
desired to take her as his wife or concubine. Baha
himself took her as a concubine. Because he was
thwarted, the Consul showed special enmity to Baha
and his followers. The only child of this wife, a
girl, was born at Acca in 1873. The three wives
survived Baha. After his death one of them suffered
gross indignities at the hands of Abbas Effendi,
being furiously attacked by him in his own house,
so that she fled precipitately. This, at least, is the
report of Khadim Ullah, the lifelong amanuensis of
Baha Ullah.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>It should be noted that all of Baha's wives<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
children, and that the first wife had a living son
(Abbas) when he took the second wife, so that the
usual excuses cannot be pleaded in palliation. For
it is common for Bahais in Persia to quote their law,
in speaking to a Christian, as meaning that a man
may take an additional wife if the first one is childless.
Mr. Phelps pleads<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> in extenuation for Baha
Ullah that "his second marriage occurred early in
his life and under peculiar circumstances, the exact
nature of which I do not know." Such an excuse
might be accepted for a man like Mullah Mohammed
Ali, the Babi leader of the Zenjan insurrection,
for, as far as is known, he entered upon his polygamous
life while he was a Mohammedan. Two of his
wives<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> were shot by a cannon ball and were buried
with him in a room of his house, while his third wife,
with children, escaped and lived at Shiraz. But for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Baha Ullah the excuse of Mr. Phelps is inadmissible,
for he was no longer a Moslem when he took the
second wife, and was thirty-three years old, and he
was fifty when he took the third wife in Bagdad,
having been born in 1817. At that time Baha had
been for many years a leader in the Babi religion,
had written the "Ikan," and announced his mission.
Nor was this polygamous union a passing phase of
his life, but one continued through thirty or forty
years. It would have concerned us little to know
the private life of Baha Ullah so long as the religion
presented itself merely as aiming at a reformation of
Islam, for it may readily be admitted that it is somewhat
less of an evil to have two wives and one concubine
than the four wives and unlimited concubines
that the Koran allows, or the nine to thirteen wives
that Mohammed took, and that if Bahaism should
cut off the temporary concubines, which disgrace
Islam, it would be doing a good thing&mdash;so far forth&mdash;but
when the "Interpreter, the centre of the Covenant,"
Abdul Baha, comes and stands in Christian
churches in London and New York and proclaims
Bahaism as a new and superior gospel, it is expedient
that Baha's real life should be made known to
the women of Christian lands.</p>

<p>It is well to note the sentiment of Oriental Bahais
with regard to plural marriage. The opinion of
those at Acca can be understood from Mr. Phelps'
narrative.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Abbas Effendi (Abdul Baha) had two
sons and six daughters. The sons died. After this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
as his sister Behiah Khanum narrates, "Many influences
and those of the very strongest character have
been brought to induce my brother (Abdul Baha) to
take another wife. Believers have urged it strongly
for several reasons. <i>Very many of them wish to take
a second wife</i> themselves. Then there is a general
wish that the Master might have a son to succeed
him. The pressure brought to bear upon him has
been very great, greater than you can imagine."
Baha desired that Abbas should take a second wife,
but he refused to do so unless Baha should command
it. There is deep pathos in the words of Abbas<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>
welling from his sorrow-stricken heart. "If it had
been God's will that I should have a son, the two
that were born to me would not have been taken
away." Albeit he was forgetful of his theology
which proclaims Baha as "God the Father incarnate."
Why did not Baha preserve alive one of the
sons rather than wish him to marry a companion-wife
in order to have another? Mr. Phelps<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> attributes
Abbas Effendi's refusal to adopt polygamy,
notwithstanding these "very powerful influences
which have urged him to do so" to "his appreciation
of the sufferings and discontent which it causes
among women."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> Certainly the animosity and bitter
quarrellings between the wives of Baha and their
respective children, resulting in a permanent split in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the family and a schism<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> in the Bahai community,
were sufficient to impress Abbas and his followers
with the evil effects of plural marriage. The narrative
shows, however, that public sentiment among
the believers at Acca strongly favoured taking more
than one wife. They evidently had no desire to give
up the license granted to them by the "Kitab-ul-Akdas."
They inclined to follow it and the example
of Baha Ullah rather than the example of Abdul
Baha.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is evident that the law and
example of Baha Ullah both sanction polygamy.
By this the social <i>inequality</i> of the sexes is fixed.
Any claim that Bahaism teaches and establishes
equal rights for man and woman is vain and groundless
boasting.</p>

<p>III. <i>The regulation of divorce</i> is another matter that
vitally affects the relation of man and woman. The
divorce law of Baha, as prescribed in the "Kitab-ul-Akdas,"
is a loose one. I again quote from Professor
Browne's translation.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> It will be noticed that the
conditions of the law are set forth from the standpoint
of the man. "If quarrels arise between a man
and his wife, he may put her away. He may not
give her absolute divorce at once, but must wait a
year that perhaps he may become reconciled to her.
At the end of this period, if he still wishes to put her
away, he is at liberty to do so. Even after this he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
may take her back at the end of any month so long
as she has not become the wife of another man."
"The practice of requiring a divorced woman to
cohabit with another man before her former husband
can take her back is prohibited." (This
abolishes one of the vile laws of Mohammedanism.)
"If a man is travelling with his wife and they quarrel,
he must give her a sufficient sum of money to
take her back to the place they started from and
send her with a trustworthy escort." From these
quotations it is evident that the wife is dependent on
the good pleasure and whim<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> of the man. He may
put away; he may take back. The law says nothing
of her right to divorce him. It does not appear that
she has the right to divorce her husband even in
case he is guilty of adultery. The penalty for
adultery is slight. A fine of nineteen miscals of
gold, equal to fifty to sixty dollars, is imposed for the
first offense and this is doubled for the second offense.
The fines are to be paid to the "House of
Justice." According to the "Bayan" of the Bab the
husband must pay the divorced wife a dowry of
ninety-five miscals of gold ($300) if they are city
folks, and ninety-five miscals of silver ($10) if they
are villagers. These are paltry sums even on the
basis of Persian poverty. I may say, in passing,
that the Laws of Inheritance give to the father a
greater portion than to a mother, to a brother greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
than to a sister, and gives the family residence to a
male heir.</p>

<p>Freedom from the marriage bond is made easy by
desertion. "Married men who travel must fix a definite
time for their return and endeavour to return
at that time. If their wives have no news from them
for nine months, after the fixed period, they can go to
another husband. But if they are patient it is better,
since God <i>loves those</i> who are patient."</p>

<p>How the husband who is away from his wife can act,
we may judge by the example of a celebrated Bahai,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
Maskin Kalam, who was agent for Baha to watch over
and spy upon Azal and the Azalis in Cyprus. His
wife was in Persia; he simply took another in Cyprus.</p>

<p>The ease with which desertion may be practiced
under Bahai law is seen in the conduct of Doctor
Kheiralla, one of the first apostles of Bahaism to
America, and founder of the Chicago Assembly.
Dr. H. H. Jessup wrote: "A cousin of Doctor
Kheiralla, who is clerk in the American Press in
Beirut, gave me the following statement: 'Doctor
Kheiralla, after the death of his first wife in Egypt,
in 1882, married first a Coptic widow in El Fayum,
whom he abandoned, and then married a Greek girl,
whom he also abandoned, and who was still living
in 1897 in Cairo. He then married an English wife,
who abandoned him when his matrimonial relations
became known to her.'"
<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
According to the claims of Bahais these loose and
imperfect divorce and marriage laws are to be accepted
and administered universally under the future
kingdom of Baha in its world-wide triumph!</p>

<p>It may be remarked in passing that Bahaism encourages
the mixture of races by marriage. Already
several American Bahais have married Persian
women, and Persian men American women. One
American Bahai woman has married a Japanese.
Abdul Baha illustrates the relation of the races by a
reference to animals. "Consider the kingdom of
the animals. A pigeon of white plumage would not
shun one of black or brown." In a tablet sent to
America, he directs: "Gather together these two
races, black and white, into one assembly and put
such love into their hearts that they shall even <i>intermarry</i>."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a>
Again he says:<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> "The coloured people
must attend all the unity meetings. There must be
no distinctions. All are equal. If you have any influence
to get the races to intermarry, it will be very
valuable. Such unions will beget very strong and
beautiful children." Mr. Gregory, an American
negro, followed this advice by marrying an English
woman, Miss L. A. M. Mathew.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The social position of women under Bahaism.</i>
Professor Browne says: "Their (the Bahais) efforts to
improve the social position of women have been much
exaggerated."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> It may be added that the success
of their efforts has been small. It is plain that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Bab recognized the deplorable condition of women
under Islam and desired to improve it. His laws
gave woman some liberties. She was permitted to
put off the veil. The Bab interpreted the prohibition
of the Koran to mean that "only the wives of
the prophet had received the order to hide the face,"<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>
so "he relieved believers from the painful restraint of
the veil." Women might appear in society, hold
conversation with men,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> and go to the mosques at
night. Baha renewed these rules of the Bab. Still
he seems to have some distrust, for the "Kitab-ul-Akdas"
says that "men are forbidden to enter any
man's house without his permission or in his absence."
Thus Bahai precepts tend in some degree to the
liberation of woman, though they fall much behind
high Christian ideals and customs.</p>

<p>There is observable a wide-spread and influential
movement among Moslems for the amelioration of
the condition of woman. This movement does not
have its source and inspiration in, nor is it peculiar
to nor confined to Bahaism. On the contrary, an
oriental writer in a review of this remarkable tendency
says: "Its birth in Moslem lands undoubtedly
is due to the impact of the Occident upon the Orient,
the missionary influence playing a large part in it."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>
The new Moslems of India, under the leadership of
Justice Sayid Ali, as well as the Young Turks,
Egyptians and others, advocate freedom and education for women and have gone much beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Bahais in practice. The Turkish women in Constantinople,
who aided in the establishment of the
constitution and are aspiring to enlarged liberty under
its &aelig;gis, know Bahaism, if at all, simply as a
Persian heretical sect. The Persian women, described
so graphically by Mr. Shuster in "The
Strangling of Persia,"<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> who formed clubs and took
such an active and heroic part in the constitutional
agitation, were not Bahai women. The Bahai
women, as well as the men, were forbidden by
Abdul Baha to take part in the struggle for constitutional
liberty.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> Professor Browne laments the lack
of patriotism shown in their conduct. Still the
Bahais deserve some credit for the movement for
the uplift of Persian womanhood. They might have
done much more, notwithstanding the limitations to
their liberty of action, had they followed out the first
ideals of the Bab. These were exemplified in the
celebrated Kurrat-ul-Ayn. This beautiful woman of
genius&mdash;poet, scholar and theologian, was a pupil
at Kerbela, of Haji Kazim, the chief of the Sheikhis.
On his death she accepted the Bab, so that though a
product of the Sheikhi sect, her fame accrues to the
honour of the Babis. At Kerbela, she gave lectures
on theology to the people from behind a curtain,
and at times, borne away by her enthusiasm and
eloquence, would allow her veil to slip off in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
presence of men. Her preaching and freedom of
conduct was objected to even by Babis, but the Bab
answered them, commending her and giving her the
title of Janab-i-Tahira, "Her Excellency the Pure,"
and made her one of his nineteen "Letters of the
Living," or apostles. She is said to have claimed
to be a remanifestation of Fatima, the daughter of
Mohammed. The Turkish government at Bagdad
began prosecution against her. She returned to
Persia and taught Babism even from the pulpit, at
Kasvin, and also by means of poetry. What were
the social results of her breaking through the restrictions
of Islam? Her husband was Mullah Mohammed
of Kasvin, who was opposed to the Bab.
On account of this she refused to live with him.
"In reply to all proposals of reconciliation, she answered:
'He, in that he rejects God's religion is unclean,
while I am 'Pure'; between us there can be
nothing in common.' So she refused to be reconciled
to her husband,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> and regarded herself as
divorced.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> Afterwards "she set out secretly to join
herself to Hazret-i-Kuddus (Lord, the Most Holy),"
that is, Mullah Mohammed Ali of Barfurush. Together
they attended, with Baha Ullah also, the celebrated
conference at Badasht, at which "the abrogation
of the laws of the previous dispensation was
announced." There a sermon was preached by
Hazret-i-Kuddus, which, says Professor Browne,
lends some colour to the accusation that the Babis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
advocated communism and community of wives."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>
This learned investigator further says: "The extraordinary
proceedings at Badasht seem to have
scandalized not only the Mohammedans but even a
section of the Babis."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> Mirza Jani, their first historian
and a martyr, avers that not all "have understood
the secret of what passed between Hazret-i-Kuddus
and Kurrat-ul-Ayn at Badasht, and their
real nature and what they meant."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> The Mohammedan
historians openly accuse them of immorality.
The Sheikh of Kum, a Bahai, told Professor Browne,
"After the Bab had declared the law of Islam abrogated
and before he had promulgated new ordinances,
there ensued a period of transition which we
call <i>fitrat</i> (the interval), during which all things were
lawful. So long as this continued, Kurrat-ul-Ayn
may very possibly have consorted, for example, with
Hazret-i-Kuddus, as though he had been her husband."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>It may be that the scandals that followed Kurrat-ul-Ayn's
venture into public life and her tragic death
in the cruel reprisals that followed the attempt of
several Babis to assassinate the Shah, gave a backset
to the efforts to liberate women in Persia. Certain
it is that during the sixty years succeeding she
has had no imitator or successor. Bahai women
have continued to wear the veil and have remained
secluded from the society of men, not only in Persia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
but at Acca, the headquarters of Bahaism. The
force of the new faith was not strong enough to free
the women. Rather they have compromised with
their environment. Only in the Caucasus and
Trans-Caspia under Russian protection, have they
partly unveiled. Not even their women of the second
and third generation have been trained to act up
to their precepts, but in Acca, as in Persia, they are
secluded from the society of even brethren in the
faith. They are more backward than some other
sects and races of Moslems. I have been entertained
in the households of Kurds and Ali Allahis and have
dined and conversed with the host and his wife. I
have, of course, conversed with the families of Christian
converts from Islam, but the wife of a Bahai has
never been introduced to me, even though I have
known the husband intimately and visited him in his
home a score of times in the course of as many years.
In a few instances I have heard of Bahai women, in
company of their husbands, receiving gentleman visitors,
but these wives had resided in Russia. An
Osmanli official, at times, receives and makes visits
in company with his wife.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> But the ladies of the
household of Baha Ullah and Abdul Baha at Acca
do not receive gentlemen as visitors even when they
are faithful and honoured American believers. Mr.
Myron Phelps, when preparing materials for his
"Life of Abbas Effendi," spent a month at Acca.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
He wished to embody in his book the interesting
narrative of Bahiah Khanum, the sister of Abbas.
She, though more than half a century had passed
over her head, did not grant him personal interviews.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>
Instead she told her narrative in installments day by
day to Madame Canavarro, who then came out and
repeated what she had heard to Mr. Phelps, who recorded
it. He says: "Social custom prevented me
from meeting this lady," and again, "Social custom
prevented me from meeting the women."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p><p>Now that the way is opened by the Revolution
and by the Constitutionalists (who were not Bahais),
liberal-minded men of all sects in Persia, Sufis,
Sheikhis, Arifs, and even Mutasharis, as well as Bahais,
are showing considerable zeal for the elevation
of women, and for female education.</p>

<p>V. What does Bahaism teach as to the <i>political
equality of man and woman</i>? The future Bahai
State and community is to be under the administration
of Boards&mdash;called Houses of Justice, local, national,
and universal. These are to be "divine
agents," "representatives of God." They are to
have absolute authority and to be infallible in their
decisions. They will adjudicate questions of property,
tithes, inheritance, divorce, and of war and
peace. They will have charge of schools and of
wives, children and servants as well as of religion.
The number of members in each Board is to be at
least nine, "according to the number of Baha."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
The members are to be all <i>men</i>. No women are to
be admitted to these Boards or "Houses of Justice."
This law evidently did not suit the notion of some of
the American Bahai sisters, so they made bold to inquire
about it. The "Infallible Interpreter," Abdul
Baha, laid down the law plainly&mdash;which cannot be
altered for 1,000 years at least. "From a <i>spiritual</i>
point of view, there is no difference between women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and men. The House of Justice, however, according
to the positive commandments of the Doctrine of
God, has been specialized to the <i>men</i> for a specific
reason or exercise of wisdom on the part of God."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>
"As to you other maid-servants, give up your will
and choose that of God." "The maid-servants of
the merciful should not interfere with the affairs
which have regard to the Board of Consultation, or
House of Justice."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>To sum up, it has been demonstrated that Bahaism
does not, by its laws, give woman equality with
the man, either in the family or the state, either as to
domestic rights or political rights; that in the matter
of education it has not tried to give equal opportunities
to girls; that it conforms to the social life of its
environment without transforming it; that the claims
of Abdul Baha before his audiences in Europe and
America were without foundation, disproved both by
the teaching and by the practice by Baha Ullah.</p>

p. 19. Abdul Baha did not break through oriental custom nor serve the
lady guests before himself. The lady pilgrim writes, "The first day at
lunch, after Baha had partaken of the honey, he passed it to us" ("Daily
Lessons," p. 16). Like the ordinary Moslem he was well pleased to sit
down to eat with the foreign ladies but never arranged that the American
Bahai men should sit down to meals with his ladies. Mr. C. M. Remey
tells, in "Observations of a Bahai Traveller," of meeting Persian Bahai
women but rarely in Persia (pp. 75-76). In Kasvin, in the garden of
Kurrat-ul-Ayn, one woman partly raised her veil and gave him a greeting
of welcome. In Teheran a lady, unveiled, and her husband entertained
the Bahais. The husband and wife received the twenty men in one room
and the wife received the dozen women in another room. They were
separated by a curtain, through which Sprague and Remey spoke, telling
of the liberty of women in the West. The lady of the house used her best
persuasion to induce the other women to mix with the men. Finally
"the women arose and drawing aside their veils with one accord entered
the room. The men made place for the ladies by retreating to the other
side of the room, while the newcomers found seats. When the women
had arisen to the situation, they were quite equal to it. Then it was the
men who were ill at ease. In fact their embarrassment was contagious,
for even I began to be uneasy and scarcely dared to take a look at the
faces opposite. Sherbets and other refreshments were served and chanting
continued. Bit by bit the men gained their ease, but, as their embarrassment
passed, the women seemed to lose courage. Little by little the
veils were drawn over their faces. Then one moved as if to leave, where
upon all arose and like a flock of affrighted birds fluttered from the room."
This incident shows how little change has been affected in the social
habits of Bahai women in sixty years after Kurrat-ul-Ayn.</p></div>

<p class="h2">Its Record as to Morals</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>The Bahais are ignorant of the dogmas of Babism and of its history
and its book. The "Traveller's Narrative," a work of Abbas
Effendi, is a bad romance, composed solely for the purpose of
proving that the Bab is simply a precursor and announcer of Baha
Ullah. With extreme bias, he misconceives in every instance the
true history, and the author has not even searched, as I have, in the
immense works of the Bab for the autobiographical notes which are
so plentiful. He is satisfied with the legends which fall in best
with the end he is pursuing. It is regrettable that a man like Abbas
Effendi should show himself ignorant of the life of the Bab.&mdash;<i>"Beyan
Persan," A. L. M. Nicolas, Vol. I, p. xvi.</i></p>

<p>To represent him (the Bab) as simply the forerunner of Baha is
an historic falsehood. It is another to pretend that the religion of
the Bab was universalized by Baha Ullah.&mdash;<i>Ibid., Vol. III, p. v.</i></p>

<p>The Bab did not consider himself as the herald or forerunner of
another dispensation, as a John the Baptist to Christ. This is devoid
of historic foundation. In his own eyes as in those of his
followers, M. Ali Mohammed inaugurated a new prophetic cycle
and brought a new revelation which abrogated the Koran. He
declared that he is not the last Manifestation. There would be a
greater, whom he calls "Him whom God would manifest," but the
Bab expected that the next manifestation would be separated from
his own by an interval such as had separated previous dispensations.
Possibly the "Bayan" indicates 1511 or 2001 years as the interval.&mdash;<i>Professor
Browne, "Introduction to Mirza Jani's History."</i>

<p class="dropcap">THE moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> conduct of the founders of a
religion, especially one that requires trust
in the person of its author, is a necessary
subject of investigation. The conduct of the immediate
followers is not to the same degree a subject
of criticism. From one point of view it is no
argument against the truth of Bahaism that Bahais
fail to live up to its precepts and principles, for this
can be said of all religions. But the claims of Bahai
writers make it necessary to consider their conduct.
They boast of superior exemplary character and
make this a proof of Bahaism. Hence it is necessary
to show the groundlessness of their assertions. In
the following review, which covers several chapters,
the conduct of Baha, Abdul Baha and their early followers
is treated together. The claim made for the
founders is nothing short of blessed perfection. For
the disciples, it is one of superlative excellence.
Myron Phelps says:<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> "This faith does not expend
itself on beautiful and unfruitful theories, but has a
vital and effective power to mould life towards the
very highest ideals of human character&mdash;as exemplified in the life of Abbas and the salient characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of his followers." The Bahai historians
say:<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> "They are remarkable only for their charity,
kindliness, purity, godliness, rectitude, sincerity,
integrity, generosity, chastity and strict avoidance
of all forbidden things." "In their conduct, action,
morality and demeanour was no place for objection....
People have confidence in their
trustworthiness, faithfulness and godliness." Abul
Fazl<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> speaks of the supernatural character and
morals of the followers of Baha, who became universally
celebrated for their just characters, good
conduct and excellent morals. So Remey:<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> "The
effect of this cause upon the lives of the peoples of
every race and religion leaves no doubt as to the
divine source of its teachings." Mirza Jani, speaking
of the proofs the Babis gave to the Moslems,
says:<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> "We say, 'We have witnessed miracles on
the part of this man.' They retort, 'He is a sorcerer.'
We say, 'Come, let us invoke God's curse on whomsoever
is in error, leaving to Him the decision.'
They reply, 'This is not permitted by our law.' We
say, 'Let us kindle a fire and enter into the midst
together.' They answer, 'You are mad.' We
further say, 'Consider the godliness, piety and self-renunciation
of those who believe.' They return us
no answer." I propose to return the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p><p>1. One characteristic of the Bahai leaders is <i>dishonesty
in dealing with their history</i>. This sometimes
takes the form of the suppression and concealment
of documents, sometimes of the omission or
perversion of essential facts or their presentation in
such a way as to falsify history. In the writing of
political history and in scheming for the triumph of
a political party, we may expect crookedness in
dealing with facts, but in the propagating of a new
religion designed to supersede Christianity and
Islam, and purporting to be an improvement on
them, we do not expect to find dishonesty and misrepresentation.
Yet this is exactly what we find,
namely, "a readiness to ignore or suppress facts,
writings or views (undoubtedly historical), which
they regard as useless or hurtful to their aims."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>When Mirza Husain Ali (Baha Ullah) started out
as a "Manifestation," it was necessary to get rid of
certain facts and beliefs held by Babis. He must reduce
the Bab from his position as the Point of Divinity&mdash;the
Lord of a new Dispensation, as well as
supplant and supersede the Bab's successor, Subh-i-Azal.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>
Thoroughly to accomplish this object (after
the Babis leaders had been put out of the way), the
history was rewritten. While claiming that the Bab
gave testimony to Baha and taking to themselves
the glory of Babi heroism and martyrdoms, the Bahais
relegated the "Bayan" and other "revelations"
of the Bab, not yet a score of years old, to dust-covered
oblivion.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> Subh-i-Azal avers that they wilfully destroyed them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
He writes<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> that thirty or more
bound books of the Bab were given in trust by him
to his relatives (Baha and his family) as trustees.
"They carried off the trust," and "making strenuous
efforts, got into their hands such of the books of the
Point as were obtainable, with the idea of destroying
them and rendering their own works attractive."
Professor Browne<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> informs us that it was very difficult
to obtain a Babi book from Persian Bahais and
next to impossible to get a glimpse of one at Acca,
where the Bahais had them concealed. The "holy,
divine books" were shelved from motives of
policy.</p>

<p>A primitive Babi work of first importance was
the "History," by Mirza Jani. This was an original
narrative of events, at first hand, prepared in sincerity
by one who shortly suffered martyrdom for the
cause (1852). But its facts did not suit the Bahais.
So it was superseded, first by the "New History"<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a>
(1880), and secondly by the "Traveller's Narrative"
(1886). Both these histories purport to be written
by European travellers. We might excuse their being
anonymous, to avoid possible persecution, but to
make pretense that the authors are travellers who
have come from afar ostensibly to investigate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
into whose mouths are put praises of the religion, is
but part of the insincerity noticeable in other things.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>
Mirza Jani's "History" passed out of sight, and it
was only because a copy had been deposited by
Count Gobineau in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at
Paris that it has reached our hands.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>Of the "New History" little need be said, except
that it perverted the history and "carefully omitted
every fact, doctrine and expression,"<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> not in accord
with the policy of Baha.</p>

<p>Let us examine somewhat in detail how Abbas
Abdul Baha treats facts in his "Traveller's Narrative."
He is undoubtedly the principal author of this work.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>
The Persian Bahai, who sent Professor Browne the
lithographed (Bombay) copy of it, wrote, "It contains
the observations of His Holiness, the Lord,
Mystery of God (May my personality be his sacrifice)."
Professor Browne was also presented with a
copy of it at Acca, which he published in Persian
with an English translation. Of it he says,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> "It was
written to discredit the perfectly legitimate claims
and to disparage the blameless character of his less
successful rival" (Azal). "There is good ground for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
suspecting a <i>deliberate misstatement</i><a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> of facts and
dates." He specifies<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> various points in which Abbas
Effendi perverted the facts. Undoubtedly one of the
aims of Abbas was to eliminate Azal. The latter
had been regularly appointed by the Bab as his successor,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>
but he refused to make way for Baha. The
Bahais tried to get rid of the question by suppressing
all mention of him, even of his name, and "of all
documents tending to prove the position which he
undoubtedly held."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> They would have consigned
him to oblivion.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> The "New History" makes but
one doubtful reference to Azal.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Professor Browne
says, "Abbas Effendi,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> in order to curtail the duration and extent of Subh-i-Azal's authority and to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
colour to their assertion that it was but temporary
and nominal, <i>deliberately and purposely antedated</i> the
Manifestation of Baha." And he continues to the
present to misrepresent the facts. In "Answered
Questions"<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> Baha is presented as the chief influence
in Persia immediately after the Bab. Other Bahai
writers repeat this error.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>2. Another practice of the founders of Bahaism is
<i>falsifying and changing the documents and texts of
their Sacred Writings</i>, namely, those of the Bab and
Baha, according to the exigency of circumstances.
Subh-i-Azal made the accusation "that the Bahais
had tampered with the Bab's writings to give colour
to their own doctrines and views."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> I pass this by,
to notice how they have tampered with their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
"Revelations." For example, take Baha's "Epistle
to the Shah of Persia." Its original text was published
by Baron Rosen.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> It is embodied by Abbas
Effendi in the "Traveller's Narrative."<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> The two
do not agree. "Very considerable alterations and
suppressions were made in the text by the author of
'Traveller's Narrative.'"<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> "The text has evidently
been toned down to suit a wider audience and to
avoid giving offense to non-believers."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<p>There is also another "Epistle to the Shah" which
is contained in the "Surat-ul-Maluk." Its tone is
strikingly different. The first is a careful diplomatic
document which acknowledges the faults of the
Babis, pleads pardon for the past and for religious
toleration. It is monotheistic, representing Baha as
a humble suffering servant, with no pretense to
Divinity. The other "adopts a tone of fierce recrimination
towards the Shah, and upbraids him for
the Bab's death, saying, 'Would you had slain him
as men slay one another, but ye slew him in such a
way as the eyes of men have not seen the like thereof
and heaven wept over him, and by God, the eye of
existence hath not beheld the like of you; you slay
the son of your prophet and then are of those who
are joyful.'" He excuses the attempt on the life of
the Shah, and threatens vengeance<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> on him. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
two Epistles to the Shah have been a puzzle to the
critics. This threatening, fierce letter seems so contrary
to the policy of Baha. An adequate and not
improbable explanation<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> would be that one letter
was prepared for the perusal of his Majesty and the
other for the Bahais, to impress them with the boldness
of their prophet.</p>

<p>Another example of this is seen in the suppression<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>
of part of the "Lawh-i-Basharat" ("Glad Tidings").
Its fifteenth section commands Constitutional
Government. When the Tablet was sent to
Russia, this section was suppressed by Bahais. The
Tablet was published in its mutilated form by Baron
Rosen. Expediency, which rules Bahai practice, required
that an incomplete "Divine Revelation"
should reach Russia.</p>

<p>Playing fast and loose with the "Revelations"
prevailed still more at the time of the bitter quarrel
and schism on the death of Baha. Though Baha's
Tablets are regarded as "Holy Books" in the highest
sense, yet the Bahais commit the grave offense of
changing them so as to misrepresent facts. Mirza
Mohammed Ali and Badi Ullah, younger sons of
Baha, in refuting the claim of Abbas Effendi to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Baha's successor, say, "Has Abbas dared to change
the texts uttered by Baha Ullah? Most certainly,
Yes. We have in our possession <i>many</i> texts of
Baha Ullah which have been changed<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> by Abbas
Effendi." Further, "he and his party have stolen
the first paragraph of a sacred Tablet and have perverted
its meaning, with deception."</p>

<p>Khadim-Ullah,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> the lifelong amanuensis of Baha,
asserts that Abbas actually rejected a "Sacred
Tablet," written in the handwriting of Baha Ullah.
Other Tablets are repudiated. For in "Hidden
Words"<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> Baha Ullah refers to the "Fifth Tablet of
Paradise" and the "Ruby Tablet." Abbas Effendi
warns against accepting any such Tablets if they
should be brought to light. What other reason for
this can we imagine than fear that their contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
would be against his claim. Enough has been said
to show the truth of the charge that the Bahais deal
dishonestly with the documents of their alleged revelation.</p>

<p>A peculiar instance of forgery occurs in the writings
of Baha Ullah. In his Epistle to the Shah Baha
quotes certain verses as from the "Hidden Book of
Fatima." This book, the Shiahs believe, was revealed
by Gabriel to Fatima, the daughter of
Mohammed, disappeared with the twelfth Imam,
and will be brought back by the Mahdi at his coming.
Professor Browne<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> wrote to Acca making inquiry
about this "Book of Fatima" and the quotations
from it. The authoritative reply which he
received was, "That naught is known of such a book
but the name, but Baha Ullah mentioned it in this
manner to make known the appearance of the Kaim"
(Mahdi). In other words, Baha was making a false
pretense of quoting from the "Book of Fatima," as
if he, as Mahdi, had brought it with him.</p>

<p>3. Bahais make <i>false representation of facts in
political history</i>. The "Traveller's Narrative" perverts
the truth for "political opportunism."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> Contrary
to the contemporary historian, Mirza Jani, and
the European chroniclers, the Shah is represented as
ignorant and innocent of and averse to the repressive
measures taken by his government against the
Babis. Let me give specific proofs of this.</p>

<p>At the first trial of the Bab, at Tabriz, according to
Mirza Jani,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> Nasr-ud-Din, then Crown Prince, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he dubs "bastard," treated the Bab disrespectfully
by rolling a globe towards him and taunting him
with ignorance of it and by ordering him to be
bastinadoed. The "Traveller's Narrative,"<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> per
contra, says, "The heavenly-cradled Crown Prince
pronounced no sentence with regard to the Bab, but
the Mullahs ordered a bastinado." The former history
states that the Prime Minister consulted, about
the execution of the Bab, with the Shah,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> who gave
him full authority to act in the matter," and that he
then communicated with Prince Hamza Mirza,
Governor of Azerbaijan, who proceeded to make
plans for it. Abbas' Narrative<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> states that "the Minister,
without the Royal command and without his
cognizance and entirely on his own authority, issued
commands to put the Bab to death"; "that Prince
Hamza utterly refused to have part in the trial and
execution." Gobineau<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> confirms the original account,
and states that Prince Hamza "took a leading
part in the condemnation of the Bab." It is
certain that contemporary Babis<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> held the Shah responsible
for their persecution and were bitter against
him. Mirza Jani records the death of Mohammed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Shah, by saying that "he went to hell"; the "New
History" affirms "that he passed to the mansions of
Paradise." Nasr-ud-Din was no puppet king, he
was fully cognizant of the affairs of state. Regarding
the imprisonment of Baha, the "Traveller's Narrative"<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a>
says, "His Majesty, moved by his own
kindly spirit, ordered investigation and the release
of Baha Ullah." He had just ordered the execution
of twenty-eight Babis, with horrid cruelties, after the
attempt on his life. Regarding the torture and execution
of Badi, who bore the Epistle to the Shah, it
says:<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> "It was contrary to the desire of the Shah,
and he manifested regret for it." This and much in
that Epistle is written with the idea of conciliating
the Shah and obtaining toleration. It is a sensible
attitude, did they not maintain it with so much misrepresentation
and hypocrisy. The real spirit of
Bahais towards Nasr-ud-Din is seen in Baha's
"Surat-ul-Maluk," and is one of "fierce recrimination."
Confirmation of this comes from conversations
with Bahais.</p>

<p>Another misrepresentation of history, which is universal
among Bahais, is in belittling the plot to
assassinate Nasr-ud-Din Shah in 1852. Abbas
Effendi says,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> "It was done by a certain Babi, by
sheer madness, one other person being his accomplice."
His sister, Bahiah Khanum, says,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> It was
"by a young Babi who had lost his reason."
Kheiralla,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> says, It was "by a weak-minded, insane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
believer." Similarly all their writers propagate a
tradition that one irresponsible man made the attempt.
It is permitted to doubt the Shiah historian,
who gives a circumstantial account of how twelve
Babis, including one high leader, laid the plot. But
Count Gobineau<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> is entitled to credence when he
says that there were a number of Babis in the plot
and three took part in the attempt. A nephew of
one of the accomplices told Professor Browne<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> that
there were seven in the plot and three of them went
out to commit the act. Why will not Bahai writers
give the facts straight?</p>

<p>Another misrepresentation fostered by them is that
of calling the Babi martyrs Bahais. Thus Abdul
Baha says,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> "When they brought Kurrat-ul-Ayn the
terrible news of the martyrdom of the Bahais, she
did not waver." Again he says,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> "Thousands of
His (<i>i. e.</i>, Baha Ullah's) followers have given their
lives, and while under the sword shedding their
blood they have proclaimed, 'Ya Baha-ul-Abha.'"
He said<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> in Doctor Cadman's church, "The King
of Persia killed 20,000 Bahais." Again,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> "In all
parts of Persia his enemies rose against Baha Ullah,
imprisoning and killing <i>his</i> converts, razing thousands
of dwellings." These are gross misstatements.
In Kurrat-ul-Ayn's time there were no Bahais, only
Babis. No such efforts as those described were ever
made to crush Bahaism. The thousands who gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
their lives were Babis. Perhaps some one remarks,
"What's the difference?" Foreign writers may not
know the difference, and an American audience certainly
does not. But Abdul Baha, from whom I have
quoted, makes a great difference. It arouses one's
indignation to read Bahai literature, in which they
claim credit for all that is noble in Babi annals, such
as the martyrdoms, and yet they disparage and deny
the Babis.</p>

<p>Read Abul Fazl's "Bahai Proofs." He said<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> to
Prince Naibus-Sultaneh, "The unseemly actions of
the Babis cannot be denied nor excused, but to arrest
Bahais for them is oppression, for these unfortunates
have <i>no connection with the Babis</i>, who took up arms,
<i>nor are they of the same religion or creed</i>." In another
place he writes<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> repudiating the wars and disorders
of the Babis, and affirming that they were
guilty of many censurable actions, such as taking
men's property and pillaging the dead, and engaging
in conflict and bloodshed. If then the Bahais
repudiate them, they must not appropriate their
glory, for the old Babis, with all their faults, were at
least heroic. Bahaism has, on the contrary, the
spirit of <i>tagiya</i>.</p>

<p>I pass on to consider Abdul Baha's representations
regarding Sultan Abdul Hamid. I present two quotations
from Tablets addressed to American believers.
The first says,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> "Here one witnesses the fairness and
impartiality of H. I. Majesty the Padishah of the Ottomans, who has dealt with the utmost justice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
equity. In reality to-day, in the Asiatic world, the
Padishah of the Ottoman Empire and the Shah of
Persia, Muzaffar-ud-Din, are peerless and have no
equals. These two kings have treated us with mildness&mdash;both
are just. Therefore, pray ye and beseech
for their confirmation in the threshold of the Almighty,
especially for Abdul Hamid, who has dealt
at all times in justice with these exiled ones." Abdul
Hamid&mdash;a peerless, just one! Surely this would
have remained among the <i>hidden things</i> had not
one "Servant of God" (Abd-ul-Baha) revealed it to
us about that other "Servant of God" (Abd-ul-Hamid).
This "revelation" is dated 1906. After
Abdul Hamid was deposed, Abdul Baha speaks<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> of
"his oppression and tyranny," for the Sultan sent
"an oppressive, august commission, that with all
kinds of wiles, simulations, slander and fabrication
of false stories, they might fasten guilt upon Abdul
Baha. But soon fetters and manacles were placed
around the <i>unblessed</i> neck of Abdul Hamid." Did
the "Infallible Pen" err in the former character
sketch? No, but Abdul Baha's oppression<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> of his
brothers, in retaining their patrimony, resulted in a
bitter quarrel and complaints, followed by an investigating
Commission and Abdul Baha's imprisonment.
On this account the whitewash scaled off from
Abdul Hamid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Another form of misstatement is their habitual way
of speaking of the imprisonment of Baha and Abdul
Baha. Abdul Baha says of Baha,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> "His blessed days
ended in the cruel prison and <i>dark dungeon</i>." "He
passed his days in the Most Great Prison."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Abdul
Baha continually speaks of himself in such words as
the following, "Forty years I was a prisoner; I was
young when I was put in prison, and my hair was
white when the prison doors opened."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> "After all
these long years of prison life." "My body can
endure anything; my body has endured forty years
of imprisonment."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> Now, what are the facts?</p>

<p>In Phelps' Life, Bahiah Khanum<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> says, "We were
imprisoned in the barracks at Acca two years
(1868-70)." Then<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> "we were given a comfortable
house<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> with three rooms and a court." After nine
years of such restriction Baha Ullah moved to a
beautiful garden outside the city and built there a
Palace, called Bahja. He had the freedom of the
surrounding country, visited Mount Carmel, and
later spent a part of each year at Haifa.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> Baha
Ullah died in this Palace, not in a <i>dungeon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>As to Abbas Effendi, during the first brief period
only he was restricted to the barracks. He was even
temporarily put in chains in the dungeon<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> when
accused of participation in the assassination of the
Azalis. After that, for a period of <i>thirty years</i>, "he
was permitted to go about at his pleasure, beyond
the walls of Acca."<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> He built a fine residence<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> at
Haifa, which I have seen. He journeyed to Tiberias
and as far as Beirut. Only after his quarrel with his
brothers and on their accusation was he ordered
back to Acca, and even then he had the freedom of
the city (1905).<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> Such are the facts about Abbas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Effendi, whom Canon Wilberforce introduced in his
church as "for forty years <i>a prisoner for</i> the cause
of <i>brotherhood and love</i>." In truth it was the quarrelling
of the brothers, Azal and Baha, that led to
the banishment from Adrianople to Acca, the murder
of Azalis by Bahais increased its severity, the bitter
hatred of the younger generation against each other
brought back the restraint.</p>

<p>4. Another immoral practice of Bahais is <i>tagiya</i>
or <i>ketman</i>, religious dissimulation. This is taught
and practiced by Shiah Moslems,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> and it is continued
with all its offensiveness against good morals by
Bahais. In it concealment, denial or misrepresentation
by word or act is allowed for self-protection or
for the good of the faith. It was formally permitted
by Baha Ullah. In accordance with this practice
Abdul Baha and his followers at Acca keep the Fast
of Ramazan<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> in addition to the Bahai Fast at Noruz.
Dr. H. H. Jessup<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> wrote, "He is now acting what
seems to be a double part&mdash;a Moslem in the Mosque,
and a Christ in his own house. He prays with the
Moslems, 'there is no God but God,' and expounds
the Gospels as the incarnate Son of God." Mirza
Abul Fazl, a Bahai missionary, lately died in Egypt.
At his public funeral<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> the Moslem <i>taziah</i>, with reading
of the Koran, was held, though he was a strenuous
worker for the abrogation of Islam. Most Bahais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in Persia live in habitual <i>tagiya</i>. Fear of persecution
is some palliation for this, but it is a great defect.
Very far from the truth is the statement of
Lord Curzon<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> that "No Babi (or Bahai) has ever recanted
under pressure." Mr. Nicolas,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> the French
Consul at Tabriz, shows from the Bab's own writings
that he himself denied his Manifestation at his examination
at Shiraz and signed a recantation. At
the execution<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> of the Bab in Tabriz (1850) two of his
intimate disciples denied the faith. The explanation
of the fact is remarkable and instructive. They were
enjoined to do so by the Bab in order that they
might convey certain documents to a safe place. In
other words, they were to lie for the faith, by divine
injunction. In another notable instance,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> seven
Babis stood firm and were executed at Teheran,
while thirty recanted, being told by their leader to
judge whether they were justified by family ties,
etc., in renouncing the faith. "They determined to
adopt a course of concealment, <i>tagiya</i>." Some years
ago a Bahai was called before the Governor of Tabriz
and questioned, "Are you a Bahai?" "I am a
Mussulman." "Will you curse Baha?" "It is
written in the Koran not to curse, I am not a Bahai."
By payment of a peshkesk this answer was made
acceptable. And no offense was recognized in conscience, for Baha had said, "If your heart is right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with me, nothing matters." It were scarcely necessary
to note that some Babis and Bahais have denied
their faith, except to correct the mistake of travellers,
but the fact that denial is permitted and approved
is important. For <i>tagiya</i> is a deeply-rooted
seed which bears evil fruits in their characters and
conduct.</p>

<p>Even their propaganda is carried on in the same
deceitful spirit. The Bahai conceals from the one
he approaches his status and beliefs, insinuates himself
into his confidence, suits the substance of his
message to the preconceptions and prejudices of his
hearer and leads him on, perhaps omitting to mention
the real essentials of Bahaism.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> One of their
methods is to worm themselves into the employ of
Christian Missions and clandestinely carry on their
propaganda while they undermine the work of the
Mission. Perhaps the Mission wishes a language
teacher or a mirza. A Bahai presents himself. He
talks well. In the course of conversation the missionary
inquires his religious views. He appears
liberal minded. Direct inquiry is made, "Are you
a Bahai?" He replies, "No, <i>I am not</i>, but I am
tired of Islam; I am a truth-seeker." The missionary
employs him. After a time, maybe, he professes
to be a Christian, and is baptized. Such were a certain Mirza Hasan and a Mirza Husain, who deceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the Swedish Mission and received salaries as Christian
evangelists, but had been and continued to be
Bahais and propagandists. I have heard that in a
certain Station (not American) Bahais, without revealing
their faith, accepted positions as cook, language-teacher,
financial agent, etc., and so surrounded
the new Mission that it was a Bahai more
than a Christian establishment. Doctor Shedd<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> tells
of an assistant he had with him in school work&mdash;a
Persian, with whom he discussed religious topics
freely. For years the man disavowed belief in
Bahaism, but finally threw off the mask and became
an active propagandist. After his dismissal he instigated
the Persian pupils, whom he had previously
secretly beguiled, and they complained to the Persian
Government that "they, as good (?) Mohammedans,
were offended by having to study the Christian
Scriptures." Great is <i>tagiya</i>!</p>

<p>What else can we expect, since Abdul Baha instructs
his disciples in pretense. A certain Madame Canavarro,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>
staying at Acca, expressed her desire to assist
in spreading Bahaism among the Buddhists, and
spoke of the difficulty of introducing it as a new religion.
Abdul Baha replied, "At first teach it as
truths of their own religion, afterwards tell them of
me." She replied that she herself was imbued with
the spirit of Buddhism. He answered, "What you
call yourself is of no consequence." To a certain
American lady who was afraid her friends would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
repelled by the idea of a new religion, Abdul Baha
advised, "Remain in the Church and teach Bahaism
as the true teaching of Christ."</p>

<p>A striking instance of this religious dissimulation
is seen in Hamadan.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> There about two-and-a-half
per cent. of the Jews have accepted Baha as the
Messiah. But many of these continue in the outward
forms and associations of the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> Others
professed to be Christians, and were protected as
such by the Shah's government. After a decade or
two it became evident that they were hypocrites,
cloaking their Bahaism under the Christian name.</p>

<p>This Oriental dissimulation takes on a different
phase in Western Bahaism. The principle of the
latter is stated thus, "Adhere to any religious faith
with which you are associated."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> "No religious
relation<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> should be severed, but these relations should
become as avenues for giving forth the message of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the Bahai faith." This idea is delusive; it is self-deception,
ignorance, or worse. No Christian can
give allegiance to Baha as incarnate God and accept,
as he then must, Islam,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> Babism and Bahaism as
successively true, and as higher revelations abrogating
Christianity, and still be loyal to Christ. Bahaism
is not a philosophy like Tolstoism, nor a theory
of economics like the "single tax"; it is a religion
as much as Mormonism is.</p>

<p>A plain example of Bahai <i>tagiya</i> is in connection
with the organization known as the "Persian-American
Educational Society." This was organized at
Washington, D. C., under the patronage of Mirza
Ali Kuli Khan, Persian Charg&eacute; d' Affaires. Its organizing
body, committee to draft its constitution,
its executive, are Bahais, yet its circular sets forth
seventeen purposes for its existence without naming
the propagation of Bahaism as one of them. It appealed
for funds on general philanthropic and educational
grounds, never mentioning its religious
motive. It introduced the names of President Taft,
Secretary Root, and other prominent men in such a
way as to lead the public to understand that the
movement had their intelligent endorsement. To
its real purpose, viz.: aiding existing and establishing
new Bahai schools in Persia and the Orient,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
am making no objection. It is the <i>concealment</i> of
this purpose which is objectionable when contributions
are asked from the general public. It claims
to be <i>unsectarian</i>, because its schools take in pupils
of all sects and religions. So do the schools of
Christian Missions, but they are none the less Christian
schools, and the "Orient-Occident" schools are
distinctively Bahai. They <i>disclaim proselytizing</i>.
The claim is simply false. Bahai schools are hotbeds
of proselytizing, and must be so by their nature.
Their law<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> says, "Schools must first train the children
in the principles of the religion." Dreyfus<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a>
adds, "There is no fear of a prescription, emanating
from such authority, ever being disregarded." The
Bahai school in Teheran worked under cover for
some years. Remey says,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> "This institution is not
generally known as a Bahai School. However, it is
in the hands of the Bahais. From the directors down
through the teachers and students, the majority were
of our faith." Similarly in Bombay,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> the Bahai
teacher concealed his faith. "The Zoroastrian parents
of his pupils suspected him of Bahaism and so
took their children out."</p>

<p>But to find the supreme example of Bahai <i>tagiya</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
we have to go to the fountainhead. Abdul Baha
himself, oblivious to its moral obliquity, lays bare
the fact in his "Traveller's Narrative."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> We have
seen that Subh-i-Azal, the half-brother of Baha Ullah,
was appointed by the Bab as his successor. According
to Abdul Baha, this appointment was a dishonest
subterfuge on the part of Baha, arranged by him
through secret correspondence with the Bab, in order
that Baha might be relieved of danger and persecution
and be protected from interference. So "out of
regard for certain considerations and as a matter of
expediency, Azal's name was made notorious on the
tongues of friends and foes even to jeopardizing his
life, while Baha remained safe and secure, and no
one fathomed the matter." Abul Fazl<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> states the
position of the "Traveller's Narrative" as follows,
"The Bab and Baha Ullah, after consulting together,
made Azal <i>appear</i> as the Bab's successor. In this
manner they preserved Baha Ullah from interference."
This account shows the low ideas of honour
and truthfulness in the minds of Baha and Abdul
Baha. And although their explanation is not true
(but an invention of their <i>tagiya</i>&mdash;<i>corrupted</i> minds),
it shows to what straits<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> they were put to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
away the succession of Azal, the legitimacy of which
Azal still, in his ripe old age, maintains. Abdul
Baha published to the world Baha's deceitfulness,
but only made the matter worse for him.</p>

<p>Of a piece with this was the action of Baha's
trusted agent, Maskin Kalam, in Cyprus. This
Bahai was sent by the Turkish Government with
Azal. "He set up a coffee-house at the port where
travellers must arrive, and when he saw a Persian
land he would invite him in, give him tea or coffee
and a pipe, and gradually worm out of him the business
that had brought him there. If his object were
to see Subh-i-Azal, off went Maskin Kalam<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> to the
authorities, and the pilgrim soon found himself
packed out of the Island." This account is given
by a faithful Bahai. Afterwards Maskin Kalam retired
to Acca and spent his old age as an honoured
guest of Baha.</p>

facts, for it is the testimony of the Bahai historian himself ("New Hist.,"
p. 5) that "the principal vice of the Persians is falsehood&mdash;so universal
and customary and so familiar that truthfulness is entirely abandoned and
ignored." "In matters relating to religion the Mullahs have shown
themselves to be ready liars and shameless forgers." The degree of reliability
of this History may be judged from the following sentence,
"When the people of Italy had proved the extent of the Pope's hypocrisy,
guile and deceit, they so effectually deposed him and his children and his
grandchildren that naught remained of him but the appearance" (referring
to 1870-1871). I have received a pamphlet by A. J. Stenstrand,
of Chicago, called "Third Call to Behaists." He writes (p. 27), "The
Babi history as well as their sacred scriptures prove that a terrible corruption,
changing and transposing of its meanings, has been going on in the
hands of the Behaists." Again (p. 28), "We have plenty of proofs that
there has been continual corruption, interpolation, changing, transposing
and stealing away the sacred scriptures of the Babi religion in the hands
of the Bahais."</p></div>

as a very large white mansion. Professor Browne was received here (1890).
He was conducted through a spacious hall, paved with a mosaic
of marble, into a great antechamber, and entered through a lifted curtain
into a large Audience Room.

Of the Garden of Baha, Sprague ("A Year in India," etc., p. 1) says,
"It is a veritable garden of Eden, with luxuriant foliage and every fruit.
Baha Ullah used to sit under the large spreading tree and teach his disciples."
Mrs. Grundy says, "The Rizwan is filled with palm trees,
oranges, lemons and wonderful flowers. A river, the Nahr Naaman, runs
through it, in two streams, on which ducks and other fowls swim. On an
island is an arbour under two large mulberry trees. A fountain plays in
the midst. Under the arbour is a chair where Baha used to sit. No one
sits in it any more. (Mrs. Grundy knelt at the foot of the chair.) The
garden has a cottage, where Baha spent his summers." A Palace and a
luxurious summer place were Baha's "Most Great Prison" during most
of his years at Acca. Compare Laurence Oliphant's "Haifa," etc., p.
103, for a fine description of his "pleasure ground." How unfounded
are such statements as Bernard Temple's (<i>S. W.</i>, p. 39, April 28, 1914).

the continual attacks of the Bahais against the Jews will exasperate our

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>In their teachings they speak constantly of knowing the truth,
but never of speaking the truth. In his book Kheiralla never mentions
veracity among the virtues nor lying among the vices. Religious
duplicity, <i>tagiya</i>, is a Persian peculiarity and some Mohammedan
sects among which are our "truth-knowing" Bahais have
raised <i>tagiya</i> to a pious privilege. Baha, the crafty chief, requires
policy in consideration of expediency, often at the expense of good
faith. Until the final triumph of the religion he has sanctioned
feigned conformity. They have divine authority for duplicity.
This is to them a pious means to a pious end. Since Baha's influence
has become paramount, they have adopted the plan of
secret propaganda which does not hesitate, in case of need, at denying
their faith under oath. Among Mohammedans they are
primitive Islamites, among Christians they claim to be primitive
Christians. If I had not taken their "private lessons," the supposition
of such astounding duplicity would have appeared incredible
or beyond even the Oriental proverbial duplicity.&mdash;<i>S. K.

<p class="dropcap">BAHAIS particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> boast of love as one of
their characteristics. They often quote the
words of Baha "to consort with all religions
with spirituality and fragrance." Phelps claims for
them<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> "a peculiar spirit, which marks them off from
other men,&mdash;whose essence is expressed in one word,
Love. These men are Lovers; lovers of God, of
their Master and teachers, of all mankind." Dreyfus,
with a forgetfulness or ignoring of facts that is
astounding, says, "Their conduct is so perfect, their
harmony so complete that although they have been
there at Acca for forty years, no judge had yet to
intervene for them in any dispute." Chase says
"Bahaism removes religious rancour."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> Let facts
speak. Let me array them first by showing the
relation of the Bahais to the Moslems, and then to
the Azalis (see chapter on "Religious Assassination")
and finally to each other (see chapter on
"The Quarrel over the Succession").</p>

<p>The Babis and Bahais show great hatred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
animosity against the Shiahs of Persia, abuse and
revile them and heap maledictions and curses upon
them. These evil feelings are shown specially against
the Mullahs and the rulers. The Babi and Bahai
historians indulge so much in diatribes and maledictions
that Professor Browne wearies of translating
them and omits pages of abuse.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> More than enough
is at hand to show the rancorous spirit of the new
religion.</p>

<p>First take a short backward glance at the Babis.
Professor Browne says:<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> "The Babis entertained for
the Kajar rulers a hatred equal to that for the
Mullahs." Mohammed Shah and Nasr-ud-Din Shah
are called "bastard" and "scoundrel" and Mohammed
Shah is consigned to hell at his death.
The Shiahs are called "foul Guebres" and the
Mullahs heaped with abuse. "They hated the Mohammedan
clergy with an intense and bitter hatred"
and anticipated the fulfillment of the prophecy "when
the Kaim or Mahdi should behead 70,000 mullahs
like dogs." The Bab called Haji Kazim Khan, chief
of the Sheikhis, "the Quintessence of Hell Fire and
the infernal tree of Zakkum." He even at times
emphasized his words with blows.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> "When a prisoner
in the household of Anti-Christ&mdash;that accursed
one (<i>i. e.</i>, the Shah), the Mullah of Maku showed
him some discourtesy, whereupon the Ocean of
Divine Wrath was stirred and He (the Bab) brought
down his staff with such vigour on the unclean form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of that foul creature that the august staff broke in
two. He then ordered Aga Sayid Hasan (his
scribe) to drive out that dog from the room, though
the accursed fellow was a person of great consideration."
"The Bab took leave of his jailer, Ali Khan,
with the words, 'Ay maalun' ('Accursed One')."<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a>
It is unnecessary further to enlarge on the feelings
of the Babis towards the Shiahs, for the sanguinary
wars and persecutions explain them and they made
no secret of their feelings of hatred.</p>

<p>I pass on to the Bahais, whom Abul Fazl claims
were reformed and transformed by Baha. Baha himself
it is, who in the "Ikan" calls the Shiahs "a foul,
erring sect," who said of his Turkish guards, "Shame
upon them! God shall consume their livers with
fire, and verily he is the fiercest of avengers" (Lawh-i-Rais)
and who exultingly celebrated, in a hymn of
triumph, the death of Fuad Pasha,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> the vizier who
had exiled him, and consigned him to hell "where
the heart boils and the tormenting angel melts him."
Baha's winsome words about the mullahs are, in the
"Ikan," "1278 years have passed and all these
worthless wretches have read the Koran every morning
and have not yet attained to a single letter of
the purport of it."</p>

<p>The spirit of <i>love</i> (?) is shown by Mirza Abul
Fazl, the preacher and apologist for Bahaism, in his
discussion (1873) as recorded in the "New History."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
His abusive language runs on page after page. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mullahs of Persia are called mischief-makers, dolts,
a pack of scoundrels, tyrants, fools, plunderers of
men's properties and wives, sectarian zealots steeped
in prejudice and thinly disguising their greed of
worldly lucre under a veil of sanctity, sprung from
the rustic population and the scum of the towns,
ignorant of the decencies of society and neglectful of
good breeding, with wickedness, worldliness, rapacity
and selfishness which are incurable and folly that
exceeds all bounds and surpasses all conception, with
stupidity, overweening arrogance and presumption
absolutely unparallelled, hiding the truth in falsehood,
circulating false reports, possessing malignant
hatred, malice, spite and great injustice, and notoriously
eager to shed blood, yet with cowardice like a
timid girl.</p>

<p>He avers further that they are lacking in patriotism,
nullify sovereign authority, encroach upon and
usurp the power of kings, dismiss viziers, invite the
people to rebel, cause national decay, set their feet
upon the necks of all mankind, menace the order and
well-being of the government, devour public wealth
and substitute treason for service. "Perish their
homes of folly whose learning is all pretense, their
colleges which never yielded a man of sense." This
is a condensation of the Bahai philosopher's amiable
(!) description of the chiefs of his national religion.
The author of the "New History" almost surpasses
him in abuse.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> He compares the mullahs to a "host
of foul reptiles who befoul and pollute the pure water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of life so that it waxeth loathsome and abominable....
They are fraudulent and sophistical hypocrites ...
inwardly reprobate and outwardly devout,
clothing themselves in the garb of spurious asceticism
and simulated piety: fabricators of 'authentic' traditions."
Later Haji M. Haidar Ali,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> writing by command
of Abdul Baha, says of Persia, "The old religious
sects ... degenerated into ferocious wolves
and mad dogs, even surpassing the ravenous man-eating
beasts." Apropos of the martyrdom of Aga Sayid
Jafar of Abargoo, "Our Great Lord and Master Abdul
Baha revealed the following in a Visiting Tablet"
to be <i>chanted at the tomb</i>: "Hell is for such as rejected
thee, fire for such as sentenced thee to death, infernal
flame for such as betrayed thee, and the hellish gulf
for such as shed thy blood."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> These quotations show
the vindictive spirit of the Bahai leaders. Any one
who is acquainted with Bahais in Persia knows that
this is the spirit that animates them, that they revile
the Mutasharis and Sheikhis and especially their
mullahs. They are brotherly and helpful to their own
particular sect of Bahais, vindictive to all who have
opposed them. Doctor Frame quotes a Persian as
saying this of the attitude of Abdul Baha, "He is
very kind towards his friends and bitter towards his
enemies." In view of all that has been brought forward,
how can Mr. Phelps aver "that they have no
trace of bitterness or resentment for their sufferings."
The habit of Bahais in denying that they have animosity against other religions reminds me of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of their own stories. A certain mullah said to his
friend, "If you notice in me any objectionable habit
please inform me." "I perceive no fault in you,"
answered his friend, "save a habit of using abusive
language." "Abusive language!" cried the mullah.
"What rascally knave calls me abusive? What
shameless ruffian have I abused that he should dare
accuse me?"</p>

<p>In the statements of Bahais which I quoted above,
they laid claim to superior chastity and sobriety. In
the chapter on "Bahaism and Woman" I have
noticed their defects in regard to the treatment of
women. In regard to sexual immorality, they are
neither better nor worse than Persians of the middle
class to which they mostly belong. Bahai law follows
the Moslem law in prohibiting the use of alcohol
as a beverage, as did the law of the Bab. The
Bab prohibited opium and tobacco. Azal follows the
Bab in these restrictions, while Baha exempts tobacco
from the prohibition. A good many Moslems, especially
of the cities and upper classes, are addicted
to alcohol, and have been through the centuries of
Islam. My observation leads me to believe that Bahais
are more addicted to the use of intoxicants than
Moslems are. Regarding the relation of Bahais to
wine and opium, we have an impartial witness who
writes his experience without prejudice or motive.
Professor Browne, in his "A Year Among the Persians,"
tells of his social intercourse with the Babis,
Azalis and Bahais. His prolonged stay in Kirman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was largely spent among the Bahais. He became
so intimate with them as to be considered one of
them by many in the city. He joined in their convivialities
and he gives us a simple narrative of everyday
events and experiences. Read the volume from
page 475 to 540 and see how many of the Bahais
lived in the habitual use of wine and opium. It is
shocking and shows what goes on behind their doors.
No other one has had opportunity to see and reveal
their hidden life. One and another and another of
the Bahais is referred to by name and occupation as
addicted to intoxicants.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> Sheikh Ibrahim "is a
drunkard and a libertine"; Usta Akbar, the pea-parcher,
"returned in a state of boastful intoxication,
talking blasphemous nonsense"; the son of the Bahai
postmaster "wants money to get drunk and play
the libertine"; Haji Shirazi is "a drinker and a libertine"
and a reviler; another is a victim of copious
libations of beer; another a drunkard and blasphemous
in his cups.</p>

<p>Regarding the use of opium they appear to be
worse. It seems to be a common habit among
them. See pages 499, 500, 505, 520, 524, 525, 540.
Of certain dinners Professor Browne says, "All
present were Babis (Bahais) and we sat sipping our
tea and whiffing opium." "We sat talking late
and smoking opium." "The wildest ascriptions of
Deity to Baha were made when intoxicated with
wine and opium: then they praised the 'Beloved.'"
"The poor lad, the son of the telegrapher whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had seen smoking opium, was dead." "A Bahai dervish
was engaged in smoking an opium pipe." The
Prince secretary, an Azali Babi, "was a confirmed
opium smoker." Browne even joined the Bahais in
the use of opium and almost became a victim of the
habit. On one occasion<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> they secretly filled his pipe
with hashish (Bhang). He recognized the taste and
refused it. Why did they do so? Would they possibly
have shown him visions with the hope of persuading
him of the truth of Bahaism? Maybe some
such incidents are the basis of the Moslem accusations
against the Bahais of using hashish on neophytes.
The point of the above citations is plain. Bahaism
does not exercise the transforming power that
is claimed for it. The Persian Bahais are yet in the
bonds of iniquity. The boasts of Bahais are ungrounded.
What of Abul Fazl's question,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> "Have
you ever heard of a Bahai accused<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> of drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
wine?<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> None are accused of evil deeds or bad
morals." Again Sprague says, "The conditions of
the Millennium are already visible among these people,"
and Thornton Chase declares, "It brings men
to a higher conception of duty and life than has been
the heritage of the churches." How blind to facts is
such faith!</p>

</p><p>
The testimony of Professor Browne as to their habits is borne out, in a
general way, without his personal experience, by others who have had
long residence in Persia. Rev. W. A. Shedd, D. D., of Urumia writes,
"Does the religion bring about a change of life and character? The reports
given by Bahai travellers are glowing, but long residents in Persia
have no such a tale to tell. The Bahais are not noticeably more honest,
more truthful, more sober nor more reliable than others" (<i>Missionary Review</i>,
Oct. 1911). J. D. Frame, M. D., of Resht says (<i>Moslem World</i>,
July, 1912), "The real test of a religion is its influence upon life. Repeatedly
we have challenged the Bahais, 'Show us from your personal
lives a power to regenerate the lives of men.'" Rev. S. M. Jordan of
Teheran writes ("The Mohammedan World," p. 179), "By neither
Moslems, Jews, nor Christians are they considered morally superior to the
Moslems, while in some respects they rightly are judged less so." The
Rev. J. H. Shedd, D. D., writes, "The Bahai freedom runs to license,
and hence as a reform leaves men worse rather than better. Mr. Browne
found himself in the meshes of the opium habit in Kirman by yielding too
freely to their influence. There is undoubtedly a generous fellowship in
the Bahai community, but there is no moral principle.... There
are no high and strong characters developed to lead the world in true reform,
no high motives to virtue are developed. The seeds of its own destruction
are in the system and the best argument against it will soon be
its fruits" (R. E. Speer's "Missions and Modern History," p. 182).</p></div>

<p class="h2">Religious Assassination</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>The religion now entered upon the phase of intestinal dissensions,
bitter animosities, schisms, and internecine strife. The
pages of its history are henceforth filled with tales of dissension
and disruption; of anathemas and accusations; of heresy and
apostacy reiterated and reciprocated with increasing bitterness; of
fratricidal assassinations and persecutions.&mdash;<i>Professor Browne in

<p class="dropcap">IN<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> general Bahais claim that they and their
leaders have been exemplars of love and harmony.
Specific declarations of their excellence
in this regard have been quoted. M. Abul Fazl<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a>
writes: "During the long years from the arrival of
Baha Ullah in Bagdad to the present day they have
not committed that which would disturb a single soul.
They have been killed but they have killed no one."
Mr. Horace Holley<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> says: "For forty years no judge
has had to settle a dispute between them." It behooves
us to inquire how the conduct of Baha and
his adherents shows up in this regard during the
first period of their exile. It is evident that in
Persia Baha had no sincere love for his brother Azal,
for he planned to secure safety for himself by putting
Azal's life in jeopardy. (See Chapter VIII.) It
is further plain that early in the exile jealousy, envy
and hate manifested themselves, even while Baha
was outwardly obedient to Azal. In Bagdad, says
Bahiah Khanum, "disharmony and misunderstanding
arose among the believers&mdash;discord&mdash;strife&mdash;contention."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a>
Therefore Baha went off to Kurdistan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
He refers in the "Ikan" to the dissensions,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> "Such
an odour of jealousy was diffused, banners of discord
hoisted, enemies endeavoured to destroy this servant,&mdash;hardships,
calamities and sufferings inflicted by
Moslems were as nothing compared with what hath
been inflicted by the believers." His opponents say
that he wished to introduce innovations, relax the
law and put forward on his own account a claim to
be a Manifestation and being resisted in this, he "got
angry."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> After they were removed to Adrianople
the quarrel waxed hotter. Abul Fazl describes it as
one of "interior fires of dissension and jealousy between
the rival leaders, far exceeding the jealousy of
outsiders.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> Mohammed Jawad Kasvini says<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> there
were "all manner of intrigues, falsehoods and untruths."
I have received from a Moslem convert to
Christianity an interesting account of conditions then
and there. He was at that time a <i>peesh-khidmat</i> to
the Persian Minister at Constantinople. He was at
Samsun when Azal and Baha and their parties embarked
and was introduced to them by Haji Rajab
Ali Khan, brother-in-law of my informant. He saw
them day by day and became a serious inquirer.
Afterwards he went to Adrianople bearing presents
to Baha. He found Baha and Azal living in separate
rooms of the same house under guards. The two
brothers were in dispute over the supremacy, and
the <i>murids</i> had been won over by Baha. He narrates, "I entered one day. I heard words of angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
disputation and revilings. Yahya said, "Ay! Husain
Ali, you are vile! Do you not remember your
sodomies? You are defiled. Your wife is a bad
one!" Husain Ali answered, "Ay, cursed one!
Your son Nur Ullah is not your son but son of
Sayid&mdash;&mdash;. You yourself are a sodomite, an
adulterer." Such like revilings they hurled at each
other. I called Maskin Kalam and said to him,
"What are these words and doings? If Baha is
true why does he talk so? Why do these brothers
revile each other? What a fool I am to come so
many miles to hear such revilings from a divinity!"
We then went to the room of Ishan. My companion
said to Ishan, "Why do they curse so?" I said,
"I wish to ask a question." He said, "What is it?"
I said, "You say they do not work miracles, but
must there not be personal power and influence in
words?""<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></p>

<p>The condition at Adrianople culminated in a series
of crimes, which now come before us for examination.</p>

<p>Charges have been made, in detail, against the
companions of Baha Ullah of assassinating the
Azalis, the followers of his rival Subh-i-Azal. Most
of the information regarding the matter is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
found in the books and translations of Professor
Browne, the great authority on Bahaism in the
Anglo-Saxon world. I wish to present and weigh
the evidence in hand regarding these accusations.</p>

<p>1. The first charge is <i>that Baha Ullah attempted
to poison Subh-i-Azal, his half-brother</i> and predecessor.
This charge is found in the "Hasht Behesht,"
a history of Babism, by Aga Sayid Javad,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> a prominent
Mullah of Kirman and a leading disciple of the
Bab. The occurrence took place when Azal and
Baha were both at Adrianople under surveillance
of the Turkish authorities. Baha, so it narrates,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a>
ordered that there should be placed before him and
"Azal a dish of plain food, with one side of which
he had mixed some poison, intending to poison Azal.
For hitherto the apportioned breakfast and supper
had been from the house of Mirza Husain Ali (Baha
Ullah). When that poisoned dish was placed before
them, Baha pressed Azal to take of it. By a fortunate
chance, the smell of onions was perceptible in
the food, and Azal, being averse to onions, refused
to taste it. Though urgently pressed, he refused,
saying: 'It smells of onions.' Baha, supposing his
evil design was suspected, and to disguise the truth,
ate a little from the other (unpoisoned) side in order
that Azal's suspicions might be dispelled and that he
might eat of the poisoned side. Now, inasmuch as
the poison had to some extent diffused itself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
other side, it produced some slight effect on Baha,
causing him sickness and vomiting, so that he summoned
his physician." This account was confirmed
by Mirza Abdul Ali, the son of Subh-i-Azal, to Professor
Browne, when he visited him in Cyprus in
1888.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></p>

<p>The daughter of Baha, Bahiah Khanum, gives a
contradictory account of the same affair.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> She says
that the feast was at Azal's house and that rice for
both was served on the same plate, having been prepared
in Azal's house. "The portion of rice intended
for my father was flavoured with onions, of
which he was very fond. The servant, by direction
of Azal, placed this portion towards my father. He
ate some of it, but fortunately not very much. He
preferred the rice prepared for Azal, and ate of it.
Soon after eating he became ill. The physician declared
that he had been poisoned. He was so desperately
ill for twenty-two days that the physician
said he could not live." Mirza Abul Fazl, a Bahai
writer, says,<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> "Azal sought to poison Baha Ullah,
and attempted to do so twice, but failed to accomplish
his design." "He repeatedly planned to murder
Baha." Baha himself alludes to these events in
the "Sura-i-Haykal."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> "My brother warred with
me. He desired to drink my blood. He took counsel
with one of my attendants tempting him unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
this. We went out from among them and dwelt in
another house. Neither did we see him afterwards."</p>

<p>Thus we have brother against brother, each accusing
the other of attempting fratricide. How shall
we settle the question of veracity? Mr. Phelps
makes a plea for Baha, but his words lack foundation.
He says that Azal's story "is a <i>transparent</i>
fabrication because it assumes an impossible ignorance
on the part of Baha Ullah that Azal disliked
onions, as well as the impossible hypothesis that
Baha Ullah would knowingly partake of food in
which poison had been placed." But neither of
these "impossible" things are a part of the story.
The first objection can only be taken, if at all, to
Professor Browne's abridged account in the "Traveller's
Narrative," and not to the original in "Hasht
Behesht," which distinctly states that onions had
communicated their flavour to the other side of the
platter, contrary to intention; and, secondly, Baha
supposed when he ate (according to the "Hasht
Behesht" account) that the poison had not communicated
itself to his side of the platter of rice. Those
familiar with Persian <i>pillau</i>, or boiled rice, in which
each grain is separate and dry, will see that it would
ordinarily be quite possible to put onions and poison
on opposite sides of the platter without either reaching
the other side. Each man would help himself,
according to Persian custom, from the side of the
dish next to him. Moreover, it was customary to
prepare the food for Azal in the kitchen of Baha.'
<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Up to the time of the incident they had both continued
to live in the same house. This is evident
from Baha's words in the "Sura-i-Haykal," where
he says, "We went out, dwelt in <i>another house,
neither did we see him afterwards</i>." This agrees
with the "Hasht Behesht." In this and several
other particulars the narrative of Bahiah Khanum is
defective or misleading. Mr. Phelps' plea, on account
of the character of the Bahais, begs the question.
This charge and subsequent ones to be discussed,
involve the integrity of Baha's character and
that of his immediate disciples. The history shows
no more reason to believe Baha than to believe Azal,
but rather less.</p>

<p>2. The next charge of the Azalis is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a>
"Shortly after this, another plot was laid against
Subh-i-Azal's life, and it was arranged that <i>Mohammed
Ali, the barber, should cut his (Azal's) throat
while</i> shaving him in the bath. On the approach of
the barber, however, Subh-i-Azal divined his design,
refused to allow him to come near, and, on leaving
the bath, instantly took another lodging, and separated
himself entirely from Mirza Husain Ali and
his followers."</p>

<p>On the Bahai side, Bahiah Khanum says,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> "One
day in the bath Azal asked the servant (of Baha)
'whether it would not be easy for an attendant who
was not faithful to Baha to make away with him
while shaving him.' The servant replied that this
was certainly the case. Azal then asked whether, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
God should lay upon him the command to do this,
he would obey it? The servant understood this to
be the suggestion of such a command, and was so
terrified by it that he rushed screaming from the
room. This occurrence was ignored by my father,
and our relations with Azal continued to be cordial."</p>

<p>Here we have two stories in direct contradiction
to each other. It may be observed that the attendant
or barber, who was that day serving Azal in the
bath, as is agreed by both parties, was a partisan of
Baha,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> without doubt the same barber, Mohammed
Ali, who subsequently murdered the Azalis,<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> and who
was decorated by Baha with the title Dallak-i-Hakikat,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a>
"The Barber of the Truth." It was much
more natural that Azal should be suspicious of him
than try to tempt him to kill Baha.</p>

<p>In either case, what do we see? Behold, these
two "Manifestations of God" accusing each other
of attempting assassination. They were brothers,
both eminent disciples of the Bab, the "Point of
Divinity" of the "new Revelation," both "revealers
of inspired verses." The heart of each was full of
hatred and envy and of desire to overreach the
other. Neither is worthy of credence, both being
steeped in Persian deception from childhood. Possibly,
at that time, each was ready to compass the
death of the other. The subsequent history, however,
casts back its reflection upon the murder-plots
at Adrianople, and in its lurid light the character of
the Bahais grows darker. As a consequence, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
charges of the Azalis against the Bahais become
probable and are easily accepted.</p>

<p>3. The <i>proved assassination of Azalis by Bahais
at Acca</i>. The quarrels and plots at Adrianople led
to complaints of each party against the other before
the Osmanli Government. For the sake of peace
and safety they were separated. Azal was sent as
a prisoner-pensioner to Famagusta, Cyprus. Baha
was removed to Acca, Syria. The "Hasht Behesht"
says:<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> "With the latter were his family, about
eighty of his adherents, and four of Subh-i-Azal's
followers, to wit, Haji Sayid Mohammed of Ispahan,
Aga Jan Bey, Mirza Riza Kuli of Tafrish, and his
brother Aga Mirza Nasrullah."</p>

<p>These Azalis were murdered by the Bahais in
Acca. Of this crime there are many who give testimony,
(<i>a</i>) The "Hasht Behesht" says:<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> "Before
the transfer was actually effected, however, Mirza
Nasrullah was poisoned by Baha, at Adrianople.
The other Azalis were assassinated shortly after
their arrival at Acca, in a house which they occupied
near the barracks, the assassins being Abdul Karim,
Mohammed the barber, Husain the water-carrier,
and Mohammed Javad of Kasvin" (all attach&eacute;s of
Baha).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Subh-i-Azal independently confirmed this account
in conversation with Professor Browne.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Bahai testimony also confirms it. Professor
Browne heard the story at Kirman from Sheikh
Ibrahim, a Bahai, who had suffered imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and torture for the faith, and who had seen some of
the perpetrators while on a pilgrimage to Acca. He
said,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> "The Babis were divided into two factions.
So high did feeling run that the matter ended in
open strife, and two Azalis and one Bahai were
killed" at Adrianople. "The Turkish Government
sent seven<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> Azalis to Acca with Baha. They&mdash;Aga
Jan, called Kaj-Kulah, Haji Sayid Mohammed of
Ispahan, one of the original companions of the Bab,
Mirza Riza, a nephew of the last, Mirza Haydar Ali
of Ardistan, Haji Sayid Husain of Kashan, and two
others whose names I forget&mdash;lived all together in a
house situated near the gate of the city. Well, one
night about a month after their arrival at Acca,
twelve Bahais (nine of whom were still living when
I was at Acca) determined to kill them and so prevent
them from doing any mischief. So they went
at night, armed with swords and daggers, to the
house where the Azalis lodged, and knocked at the
door. Aga Jan came down to open to them, and
was stabbed before he could cry out or offer the least
resistance. Then they entered the house and killed
the other six." In consequence, "the Turks imprisoned
Baha and all his family and followers in the
caravanserai, but the twelve assassins came forward
and surrendered themselves, saying, 'We killed
them without the knowledge of our Master or of
any of the brethren. Punish us, not them.' So they
were imprisoned for a while; but afterwards, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
intercession of Abbas Effendi (Abdul Baha), were
suffered to be at large, on condition of remaining at
Acca and wearing still fetters on their ankles for a
time."</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Mr. Laurence Oliphant gives an account of
the Bahais at Acca in his "Haifa, or Life in Modern
Palestine."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> He substantiates the account of the
assassinations, and narrates how Baha Ullah was
called before the Osmanli Court to answer on the
charge of complicity in them. He further states
that after one session, Baha "purchased an exemption
from further attendance at court <i>with an enormous
bribe</i>."</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The defense, unable to escape the force of the
damaging testimony or to deny the facts against
such testimony, can only offer some excuses in extenuation.
Bahiah Khanum<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> reduces the number of
Bahais who made the attack on the Azalis to three,
asserts that their intention was to threaten death and
frighten but not to kill them, that but two Azalis were
killed and also one of the Bahais, that the provocation
was that the Azalis had slandered Baha Ullah,
forged letters in his name, which incited the Government
against him and were threatening to kill him,
and further that Baha was not cognizant of their
intention. But Professor Browne shows that Baha
regarded the murder with some complacency at
least,<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> and refers to it in the "Kitab-ul-Akdas," saying,
"God hath taken away him who led you astray,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
viz.: Haji Sayid Mohammed, one of the murdered
men, who was Azal's chief supporter. He also confirms
the fact that Abbas Effendi interceded for the
murderers and secured their freedom from adequate
punishment. Just as Brigham Young<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> condoned
and secured immunity from punishment, if he did
not justify or instigate the crimes of his sect. Bahiah
Khanum herself shows us that the murderers
acted for the religion, and not from any private or
personal motives; in other words, committed "religious
assassination," after the traditional oriental
custom.</p>

<p>The same is shown and more facts brought out in
the defense made by Mohammed Jawad Gasvini.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
He writes that the three persons mentioned above
published tracts which were calculated to excite the
populace against Baha and his adherents. One,
Nasir Abbas of Bagdad, came from Beirut to kill
them but was enjoined by Baha not to do so. Then
"Some believers organized a secret meeting to put
an end to these evil doers. The author was among
them and was of their opinion." Baha again restrained
them, so the author avers. But, he continues,
"The following seven persons secretly determined to
put out of the way the aforesaid intriguers" (here
follow their names and occupations). "These seven
began to consort with the intriguers very cordially,
pretending that they were in accord with them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with their belief, and continued to do so for some
time. But one afternoon they entered their residence,
which was situated opposite the residence of
the governor of the city of Acca, and there they killed
the said Sayid Mohammed, and Aga Jan, and Mirza
Riza Kuli. This took place in the year 1288 <span class="smcap">A. H.</span>,
<i>i. e.</i>, 1870 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> When the Government heard of the
tragedy it arrested the said seven and arrested all
the followers of Baha Ullah who were in Acca." All,
including Baha Ullah, Abbas Effendi and the other
brothers were imprisoned. Baha was released after
three days, after being interrogated by the court.
Sixteen of the Bahais were confined in prison for six
months and the seven for terms of seven to fifteen
years, afterwards reduced by one-third. Thus
twenty-three out of about forty male believers were
found guilty of the assassinations or of complicity
in the plot.</p>

<p>4. Various and <i>sundry other assassinations for the
faith</i>. According to the Azali historian, these murders
were followed by many others. Certain disciples
separated themselves from Baha. Of these
some fled from Acca,<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> "but the Khayyat Bashi (chief
tailor) and Haji Ibrahim were assassinated in the
caravanserai of the corn-sellers and buried in quicklime
under the platform. Another, Haji Jaffar, importunately
pressed his claim for a debt of 1,200
pounds which Baha owed him. (I wonder whether it
was incurred to meet the 'enormous bribe.') Thereupon
Baha's amanuensis, Mirza Aga Jan Kashani,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
instructed a disciple, Ali of Kasvin, to slay the old
man and throw his body out of the window of the
upper room which he occupied in the caravanserai."
It was then reported "that he had cast himself out
and died, yielding up his life to the Beloved." "All
the prominent supporters of Subh-i-Azal, who withstood
Baha, were marked out for death,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> and in
Bagdad, Mullah Rajab Ali Kahir and his brother
Haji Mirza Ahmad, Haji Mirza Mohammed Riza
and several others fell one by one by the knife or the
bullet of the assassin." The following others are
specified with the place and name of the assassin,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a>
"Aga Sayid Ali the Arab, one of the original 'Letters
of the Living,' was killed in Tabriz by Mirza Mustapha
of Nirak; and Aga Ali Mohammed by Abdul
Karim; Haji Aga of Tabriz met a like fate, as did
Haji Mirza Ahmad, the brother of the historian Haji
Mirza Jani.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> Another, whose faith had grown cold,
was Aga Mohammed Ali of Ispahan, who was residing
at Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> Mirza Abul Kasim was
sent from Acca with instructions to "bleed that block
of heedlessness whose blood is in excess." He robbed
his victim of &pound;350, with part of which he bought
and sent goods to Acca. Another instance was
Mirza Asad Ullah "Deyyan," who claimed to be a
"Manifestation."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> "Mirza Husain Ali (Baha), after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a protracted discussion with him, instructed his servant,
Mirza Mohammed of Mezanderan, to slay him,
which was accordingly done." Count Gobineau
confirms this account.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> Concerning these crimes we
have also the independent testimony of Subh-i-Azal,
who mentioned most of these instances by name and
added several others. Azal said to Captain Young,
a British officer in Cyprus,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> "About twenty of my
followers were killed by the Bahais." He confirmed
it in an autograph letter to Professor Browne, saying,
"They (<i>i. e.</i>, the Bahais) unsheathed the sword of
hatred and wrought what they would. They cruelly
put to death the remnant of my friends who stood
firm." In the "New History"<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> Professor Browne
names over the list of those assassinated, and adds,
"Of the more prominent Azalis, Sayid Javad, of
Kerbela (or Kirman), seems to have been almost the
only one who long survived what the Azalis call
'The direful Disorder.'" In Kirman, Professor
Browne said to the Bahais,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> "From a statement of
one of your own party, it appears that your friends
at Acca, who complain so much of the bigotry, intolerance
and ferocious antagonism of the Mohammedans,
and who are always talking about 'consorting
with men of every faith with spirituality and
fragrance,' could find no better argument than the
dagger of the assassin wherewith to convince the
unfortunate Azalis."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The conduct of the primitive Babis and their
leaders, and <i>their attitude towards the taking of life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a>
has a bearing on the question of the conduct of the
Bahais, for up to the time of the residence at Adrianople
they were identical. The history of the Babis
is a bloody one. The "first bloodshed which took
place in Persia (in connection with the Babi movement)
was the murder of a Shiah Mujtihid by one or
more Babis." It was a "religious assassination."
The circumstances were as follows,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> When the Bab,
as captive, passed through Kasvin, <i>en route</i> for Maku,
he wrote a letter asking succour from Haji Mohammed
Taki, an orthodox Mujtihid, who was the
father-in-law of the celebrated Kurrat-ul-Ayn. "The
Haji tore the letter into fragments, and made some
unseemly remarks." When this was reported to the
Bab, he said, "Was there no one to smite him on the
mouth?" The Bahai historian (1880) continues,
"Wherefore the Lord brought it to pass that he was
smitten in the mouth with a spear head that he might
no more speak insolently." Shortly afterwards a
certain Babi,<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> named Salih, hearing the Mujtihid
curse and revile Sheikh Ahmad, the teacher of the
Bab, entered the mosque and slew him at the pulpit.
The Bahai historian continues, "This was the consequence
of the Haji's conduct to the Bab, and agreeable to the tradition of the Imams, 'whosoever curseth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
us ... is an infidel,' and so he deemed it
incumbent on himself to slay him."</p>

<p>A variation of this story is found in a work by an
American Bahai, Mary H. Ford, called "The Oriental
Rose."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> She narrates that Kurrat-ul-Ayn heard the
Mujtihid cursing the Bab, and gazing upon him she
exclaimed, "How unfortunate you are! For I see
your mouth filled with blood!" "The following
morning, as he was crossing the threshold of the
mosque, he was struck upon the mouth by the lance
of a hidden assailant. The attack was followed up
by five or six other assassins, who beat the life out
of his mangled body." "The strange insight of
Kurrat-ul-Ayn had foreseen it." "The assassination
removed a serious obstacle from her pathway."</p>

<p>From these narratives, both from the pens of
"Friends," it is evident that the Bab and Kurrat-ul-Ayn
each spoke words which were direct instigations
and incitements to their fanatical followers to commit
murder. The chief murderer fled and "joined himself
to the people of God" at Sheikh Tabarsi. Disregarding
his crime, they welcomed him to their
ranks as a "follower of God, and he attained to
martyrdom."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></p>

<p>We can admire the courage and devotion of the
Babis, but certainly their hatred and fanaticism carry
them on to retaliation and revenge which are far from
pure religion. Witness their deeds! Farrukh Khan,
a prisoner of war, was first skinned alive and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
roasted,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> and twenty-two prisoners of war were put
to death at the same time, at Zanjan. At Sheikh
Tabarsi, by order of Janab-i-Kuddus, His Excellency
the Holy, the enemies slain in battle were decapitated
and their heads set on posts around the ramparts.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></p>

<p>The attempt to assassinate Nasr-i-Din Shah (1852)
shows also the murderous spirit of the Babis. From
seven to twelve<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Babis were engaged in the plot, and
four of them started out to take part in the assault.
It was not, as is commonly represented by Bahais,
the act of an unbalanced, weak-minded individual,
but the revengeful plot of a number. The spirit of
vengeance was very strong within them. Of this we
have a witness from a very unexpected quarter,
namely, the celebrated Bahai apologist, Mirza Abul
Fazl. He writes,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> "Numerous historical and tangible
evidences can be furnished to prove that it was the
pen of Baha Ullah which protected from death his
own enemies, such as Subh-i-Azal, Nasr-i-Din Shah
and certain great doctors and divines. Otherwise
the Babis <i>would not have allowed a single one of these
people to have escaped alive</i>." He certainly must include
Bahais, for the Babis would not have desired
to kill Subh-i-Azal. But the assertion of M. Abul
Fazl, that Baha was as the "Prince of Peace" among
a lot of untrained, untamed disciples, will not stand investigation.
For Baha's history shows the contrary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Baha also commends suicide for his sake.</i> It is
narrated by Abdul Baha<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> that rather than be separated
in exile from Baha, "Haji Jafar was moved to
lamentation, and with his own hand cut his throat."
Baha, in the Lawh-i-Raiz, alluded to this event, saying,
"One from amongst the Friends sacrificed himself for
myself and <i>cut his throat with his own hand for the love
of God</i>. This is such that we have not heard from
former ages. This is that which God hath set apart
for this dispensation." Another disciple attempted
suicide about the same time.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> This "old and faithful
follower seized a knife and exclaiming, 'If I must be
separated from my Lord, I will go and join my God,'
cut his throat. With the aid of a physician, his life
was saved. Again when the ship bearing the exiles
reached Haifa, Abdul Ghaffar, finding himself to be
separated from his Lord, determined to sacrifice his
life, and threw himself into the sea from the steamer,
exclaiming, 'O Baha! O Baha!'" The sailors rescued
him.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> This tendency to suicide reveals an
astonishing degree of fanaticism among the Bahais.
But suicide is so rare among the Persian Shiahs that
these reports arouse suspicion and call for further
investigation. I was informed of one person whom
the Bahais at Acca reported as a suicide, but who in
reality had been murdered by them. Of another,
named Haji Mirza Riza, who would have written a
history favourable to Azal, the latter wrote to Professor
Browne that "they (the Bahais) sought to slay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
him, and at length gave out that, on the first night
of his imprisonment, he had bound a cord about his
throat and destroyed himself and so became a
martyr."<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> The celebrated Nabil, Bahai poet and
historian, is reported to have committed suicide by
throwing himself into the sea, shortly after the death
of Baha Ullah. "He could stay on earth no longer&mdash;he
loved and yearned so for Baha Ullah."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> As this
same Nabil had himself claimed to be the Manifestation,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a>
it was very convenient that he should make
away with himself at that time, instead of renewing
his pretensions.</p>

<p>These instances of suicide are cited as proofs of
the truth of the religion by M. Mohammed Husain
Shirazi, who says,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> "More faithful and devoted (than
the early Christians), some martyrs of our day have
killed themselves with their own hands out of devotion
to their Lord Baha." Again Baha sent Badi, the
messenger, to the Shah, with the "Epistle" from
Acca, assuring him beforehand that he was going to
death.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> The letter could easily have been sent
through one of the foreign consulates without
sacrifice of life.</p>

<p>Doctor Jessup says:<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> "They teach unscrupulous
persecution of those obnoxious to them. I had a
friend, a learned Mohammedan of Bagdad, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Ibrahim Effendi, of scholarly bearing, refined and
courteous&mdash;a brother of the wife of Abbas Effendi.
His father, a wealthy man, died when he was young
and his uncle determined to bring him up as a
Babite (Bahai). But the boy refused to accept it.
His uncle then robbed him of his property," and
threatened him. He fled and came to Beirut. He
professed Christianity and was baptized at Alexandria,
Egypt. While at Beirut, "he went down to Acca to
visit. One night he found that his life was in great
danger if he stayed through the night and he escaped
to Beirut in great terror."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></p>

<p>7. <i>Psychological attestation of the accusation</i> against
the Bahais, of assassination, is seen in their doctrine
of the power and prerogative of the "Manifestation,"
and the inference made by the Bahais from that
doctrine. This is set forth in the Tablet of Ishrakat,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a>
"Verily He (Baha) hath come from the Heaven
of the Unseen, and with Him the standard of 'He
doeth whatsoever He willeth,' and the hosts of power
and authority. As to all else save Him: It is incumbent
upon them to cling unto that which he
hath commanded." "Woe unto those who denied
and turned away from Him." "The Most Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Infallibility" is applied only to one (the Manifestation),
whose station is sanctified above commands or
prohibitions. He is proof against error. Verily if
he declares heaven to be earth, right to be left, or
south to be north, it is true, and there is no doubt of
it." "No one has a right to oppose him, or to say,
'Why or wherefore'; and he who disputes Him is
verily of the opposers." "He doeth whatsoever he
willeth, and commandeth whatsoever he desireth."</p>

<p>In like manner Abdul Baha states the authority
of the Manifestation,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> "He is not under the shadow
of the former laws. Whatever he performs is an
upright action. No believer has any right to
criticize." "If some people do not understand the
hidden secret of one of his commands or actions,
they ought not to oppose it."</p>

<p>These principles are boldly interpreted and applied
by the Bahais to the subject under discussion.
Sayid Kamil, a Bahai of Shiraz, said to Professor
Browne<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> with a look of supreme surprise, "You
surely cannot pretend to deny that a prophet, who
is an incarnation of the Universal Intelligence, has a
right to inflict death, openly or <i>secretly</i>, on those
who stubbornly opposed him. A prophet is no
more to be blamed for removing an obdurate opponent
that a surgeon for an amputation of a
gangrenous limb." This opinion prevailed among
the Bahais. At Yezd they said,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> "A divine messenger has as much right to kill and compel as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
a surgeon to amputate." The Bahai missionaries
maintained<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> that, "A prophet has a right to slay if
he knows it necessary; if he sees that the slaughter
of a few will prevent many from going astray, he is
justified in commanding such slaughter. No one
can question his right to destroy the bodies of a few
that the souls of many may live." A Bahai acquaintance
of Doctor Frame, of Resht, told him<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>
"without any appearance of shame, that he paid so
much to have a persecutor removed."</p>

<p>8. In connection with all the above facts, it must
be kept in mind that "<i>religious assassination has
been freely practiced since the beginning of Islam</i>,
and that the prophet Mohammed gave it the sanction
of his example on numerous occasions." Professor
Browne,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> who thus emphasizes this fact, and
gives instances from the Moslem biographies of Mohammed,
points out its bearing on our judgment
regarding the assassinations alleged against the
Bahais, and concludes, "In Asia a different standard
of morality prevails in this matter." Certain facts
regarding the Imams revealed in the dark annals of
Islam show what historical precedents the Babis and
Bahais had back of them. Consider the deaths of the
twelve Imams. Ali was<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> assassinated with a dagger,
Husain killed after battle, nine other Imams were
<i>poisoned</i>, and the last one mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>To sum up. Our investigation has led to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
conclusion that the Bahais were guilty of these
assassinations as charged. The evidence is both
direct and circumstantial, with names and places.
Some of the witnesses are still living. Some have
given their testimony in writing, some in conversation
with Europeans, who have reported it accurately
to the world. The environment in which they lived,
and the historical and theological traditions on
which they fed, strengthen the direct proofs.</p>

<p>The answer to these charges by Mirza Abul Fazl
in his "Brilliant Proof"<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> is, that we should hear both
sides, and that it is not right to accept the witness of
enemies against the Bahais, which is as that of Protestants
against the Catholics and <i>vice-versa</i>. Our
reply is, that both sides have been heard, and examined,
and that some of the most damaging testimony
is from Bahais themselves. It should be noted
that the testimony is altogether from the followers of
the Bab, of various kinds and not from Moslem
writers. Mr. Phelps, like many Bahai writers, would
ignore the charges. He says,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> "I do not think that
it would be time well employed to advert to them
in detail." He pronounces them "incredible" and
"flatly in contradiction to the spirit, lives and teachings
of Baha Ullah and his successor," and destined
"quickly to fade away and be forgotten, if left to
themselves." No indeed! Lovers of truth will not
overlook and forget such a record. They will judge
Bahais by their deeds, not by their professions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The conclusions of Professor Browne, who was undoubtedly
a favourably-inclined judge, who investigated
impartially and heard the testimony on both
sides, has the greatest weight in determining the
judgment of the world.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> In the "Traveller's Narrative,"
his first volume on Babism and Bahaism, he
states that it is only with great reluctance and solely
in the interest of truth, that he sets down these grave
accusations against the Bahais, and adds,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> "If they
are true, of what use are the noblest and most humane
utterances, if they are associated with such
deeds? If they are false, further investigation will,
without doubt, conclusively prove their falsity." In
the "New History," which was published two years
later, after further investigation and calm deliberation,
he wrote,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> "At first not a few prominent Babis,<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>including even several 'Letters of the Living' and
personal friends of the Bab, adhered faithfully to
Subh-i-Azal. One by one these disappeared, most
of them as, I fear, <i>cannot be doubted, by foul play on
the part of too zealous Bahais</i>."</p>

wrote, "When I studied the Babi history and read about the terrible
cruelty and assassinations which the followers of Beha perpetrated upon
Subh-i-Azal's supporters which made no resistance, this broke the backbone
of my Behai faith." In conversation he told me that Doctor Kheiralla
had informed the Chicago assembly that the account of the assassinations
as narrated by Professor Browne was true and that the Manifestation
had a right to slay them."</p></div>

the longer dagger, the Azalis did not lack the bitter pen. Professor Browne
translates from this work as follows, "The misleadings of black darkness
brought me into the city of blood (Acca). I met Abbas Effendi, the
whisperer of evil thoughts, one of the manifestations of infidelity. Afterwards
I saw the rest of the Wicked One's followers. Their words and
arguments consist of a farrago of names, baseless stories, calumnies, falsehoods
and lies, and not one of them had any knowledge of the first principles
of the religion of the 'Bayan.' They are all devoid of knowledge,
ignorant, short-sighted, of common capacity, hoodwinked, people of darkness,
spurned of nature, hypocrites, corrupters of texts, blind imitators.
God hath taken away from them His light and hath left them in the darkness
of the Wicked One and hath destroyed them in the abysses of vain
imaginings." He was admitted to audience with Baha and narrates,
"When I came there and looked upon the Arch-Idol, that Greatest Talisman,
that personified Revolt, that rebellious Lucifer, the envious Iblis, I
saw a form upon the throne and heard the lowing of the Calf (Baha&mdash;Golden
Calf). Then did I see how the light of the Most Great Name
shone on Ahriman the accursed, and how the fingers of the demon wore
the ring. (Alluding to the theft of Solomon's ring by the demon.) For
they had written the name Baha-ul-Abha on divers writings and called it
'the Most Great Name.' Thereat there came to my mind the verse of
Hafiz:
</p>
<blockquote>
Efficient is the name divine: be of good cheer, O heart!<br />
The div becomes not Solomon by guile and cunning art."<br />

<p class="dropcap">THE claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> of Bahais in regard to the conduct
of Abdul Baha must be further considered.
Mr. Phelps describes him as a man
"who proves that self can be utterly forgotten: that
all-embracing love can be substituted for egotism:
the recorded love of Buddha and Christ may indeed
be realized." M. Asad Ullah writes: "He sees the
Moslem, the Christian and the Bahai, all with one
eye,&mdash;he is equally kind to all." Mr. Sprague affirms:
"Abdul Baha manifests universal love in every
word and act." Mr. Chase says: "Bahaism does
bring men into loving unity with each other." Abdul
Baha said in his address at Denver, Col., "All
other nations ... inquire as to the character of
this love. What love exists among the Bahais!
What unity obtains among these Bahais! What
agreement there is among these Bahais! All envy
it."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> Again let the light of history shine forth and
these claims be justified or refuted by the facts.</p>

<p>Baha Ullah died at Acca in May, 1892, in his
seventy-fifth year. The death of the father was the
signal for a bitter quarrel among his sons. The occasion
was the succession to the leadership. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
cause, no doubt, lay partly in that jealousy which results
from a polygamous household. This polygamy
was the occasion of misfortune even at the time, for
the Persian consul at Bagdad, named Mirza Buzurk
Khan Kasvini, had desired to wed one of the women
and vented his disappointment on the Bahai community
by making accusation against them before
the Persian and Turkish Governments.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></p>

<p>Baha Ullah had twelve children. The four sons
who grew to manhood received "great swelling"
titles. Abbas was entitled "The Greatest (Azam)
Branch of God" and regarded as the "return" of
Jesus; Mohammed Ali, "The Mightiest (Akbar)
Branch of God" and the "return" of Mohammed;
Ziah Ullah, "The Purest Branch and as Abraham"
(died 1898); Badi Ullah, "The Most Luminous
Branch and as Moses."</p>

<p>Abbas Effendi was the son of Aseyeh. The other
three were sons of Ayesha or Madh Ulya. Abbas
Effendi claimed the succession, basing his right and
title on the Will of Baha, called the Kitab-il-Ahd and
on previous declarations. His right was disputed by
the other brothers. I have a manuscript by a lifelong
Bahai which gives the following account:
"Nine days after the 'ascension' of Baha, Abbas
Effendi desired nine of the chief men to come to the
house of Mohammed Ali Effendi. He opened the
will. It was in Baha's own handwriting and two
pages long. The nine men saw it. On the second
page, over a part of the writing, Abbas had put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
blue paper that it might not be read, and he refused to
have it read. On the same day, the whole congregation
(men) gathered to the palace of Baha. Mirza
Majd-i-Din (Abbas' sister's son) rose and read the
will up to the blue paper. Later the women were
called to the Kasr Bahja and the will was again read,
but the concealed portion was not made known. It
was evident that it was for his own selfish purposes
that Abbas concealed it, because the future authority
did not pertain to him. From Persia and India many
wrote, saying: 'Show the last portion; it is the writing
of His Holiness.' He refused. To this day it is
concealed."</p>

<p>Abbas assumed authority as the Supreme Ruler of
the new dispensation, the Centre of the Covenant,
and the Infallible Interpreter of its teachings. His
claim is clearly set forth in a Tablet<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> wherein, speaking
in the third person, he declares: "All Bahais
must obey the Centre of the Covenant and must not
<i>deviate one hair's breadth</i> from obedience to Him."
"He should be looked upon as authority by all."
"Obedience and submission must be shown Him and
the face turned to Him completely." He was given
such titles as<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> "His Holiness the Master," "Our
Lord," "The Centre of the Cause of God," "Dawning
Place of the Divine Light," "Dayspring of the
Light of the Covenant." Indeed his first Apostles
to Persia bore the message, "I am the Manifestation
of God. My paps are full of the milk of Godhead.
Whosoever will, let him come and suck freely."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>His claims to headship were strenuously opposed
by his brothers and some of the nearest disciples. A
bitter quarrel began as a consequence and has raged
to the present time. Letters were sent by each party
to the Persian Bahais, involving them in the quarrel.
Mohammed Ali composed a book, called the
"Ityan-i-Dallil," presenting proofs of the invalidity
of Abbas' claims, from the writings of Baha. They
charge<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Abbas with concealing and annulling Baha's
will, perverting his teachings, changing the writings
of Baha, publishing expurgated and interpolated editions
of them, and attempting to suppress the authorized
Bombay editions. Specifically they accuse him
of publishing a Lawh-i-Beirut, a Tablet in which
Abbas is greatly exalted, and attributing it to Baha,
though it is spurious; that he has inserted verses
into letters written in the hand of Baha's amanuensis
and published them as genuine; has omitted verses
from the "Tablet of Command"; made up the
"Treasure Tablet" from parts of several others; appropriated
to himself Tablets pertaining to Mirza
Mohammed Ali; and commanded to destroy all
Tablets of Baha which have not his (Abbas') seal
upon them.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></p>

<p>Per contra the party of Abbas accused his brothers
of intemperance and profligacy<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> and of heresy, covenant-breaking and fraud. Mr. Hadad reported M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Mohammed Ali and Badi Ullah as "being profligate
and wanton, frequenting wine shops and being spendthrifts."
Mr. Getsinger said he had seen Badi Ullah
in the street intoxicated and being helped home by
two servants, that he and his brother had taken and
pawned the effects of Baha, rugs, hand-bags, etc.,
and a pearl rosary belonging to Baha which was
valued at $10,000 (!) and had squandered the money."
Abbas said to Mrs. Grundy,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> "Mohammed Ali has
appropriated many papers and tablets written by the
Blessed Perfection (Baha). It is possible for these
writings to be altered, as the meanings in Persian are
greatly changed by a single dot here and there. Before
His Ascension, the Blessed Perfection said to me,
'I have given you all the papers.' He put them in
two satchels and sent them to me. After His Ascension,
Mohammed Ali said, 'You had better give
me the two satchels to take care of.' He took them
away and never returned them." He said that
Mohammed Ali deceives, "for the Will was also
written by Mohammed Ali's own hand from dictation
of the Blessed Perfection. By violating the Covenant
(Will) he has become a <i>fallen</i> branch. All the beautiful
blossoms upon the Tree of Life were destroyed by
Mohammed Ali."</p>

<p>Abbas proceeded to the use of boycott and anathema.
He<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> ordered that no one of the Acca community
should send any letters anywhere without
first showing them to him, and commanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Bahais in Persia not to receive any letters that were
not sealed by him, but to send them back to him,
and that in writing to Acca they should send their
letters open. These restrictions on freedom gave
great offense. Abbas also prohibited his followers
from associating with his brothers and their followers,
strictly ordering them "not to sit, meet, speak or correspond
with them, not even to trade or associate
with them in any profession."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Khadim reports
that "once in his own house, Abbas rose up and
furiously attacked" his stepmother, who, in return,
reviled him and fled from the house, wailing. "At
the sacred tomb he used cruelly to treat the brothers
and sisters."<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> "On one occasion he repeatedly
struck his youngest (half) sister in the presence of
her little ones and many believers," scolding her
"with a loud voice, uttering many harsh words."<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a>
On another occasion he "insulted and beat Khadim
(Mirza Aga Jan, Baha's amanuensis) at the sacred
place" and afterwards "ordered his followers to imprison
and cruelly beat him, which they did."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> He
sent adrift Abdul Gaffar Ispahani, called Abdullah,
one of the first believers on Baha, in such destitute
condition that he died of hunger and was buried in
a potter's field at Damascus.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a></p>

<p>"Alas! Alas!" exclaims Mirza Aga Jan, "Abbas
Effendi has caused his followers to display such vehemence
of hatred and rancour, the like of which has
never been shown by barbarous nations, and even by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the most ignorant tribes."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> Of Abbas, Mrs. Templeton<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a>
writes: "His pride, alas, is great.... He
seems to be blinded.... With regard to business
matters Abbas Effendi has not been just to his
brothers, who have suffered a good deal in consequence."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></p>

<p>Abbas Effendi cut off the living of his stepmothers,
brothers and their dependents. Baha Ullah and his
household had a stipend from the Turkish Government,
as Azal and the Babis in Cyprus had, and it
was not an ungenerous allowance.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></p>

<p>"The family had an income from the Government,
as well as a revenue from three villages."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> "These
funds Abbas Effendi appropriated and with these
made his charitable gifts (?) leaving the forty dependents
of the younger brothers to live as best they
could."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> This excluding the protesters from their
share of the income and offerings embittered the
strife, at the same time weakening their ability to
propagate their contention. Bitterness and enmity
increased; recriminations and accusations inflamed
the passions of both sides.</p>

<p>Mirza Abul Fazl, the philosopher of the movement,
gives, as a partisan of Abbas Effendi, an account of
these times in his "Bahai Proofs."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> He describes
the "ruinous discords and divisions," "the world-consuming
flame of jealousy and hatred of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of error," "the hard hearts of the men of hostility,"
"the animosity and groundless pride," "the senseless
hatred, degradation and shame of the violators
of the covenant." He gives the opprobrious title of
<i>Nakhazeen</i> to Mohammed Ali's party. He continues,
"The evil intrigues, calumnies, false pamphlets and
accusations, evil tongues and cursings of the Nakhazeen
divided the community and filled it with foul
odours." Several outside parties tried to act as
mediators and bring about a reconciliation. Among
these were the British Consul at Haifa and Mrs.
Templeton. The younger brothers agreed to the
terms. Abbas Effendi was formally requested to
show the Will before impartial witnesses and all
were to abide by its word. "This he resolutely refused
to do and he must stand condemned for this
before all impartial men."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> After the failure of these
efforts at reconciliation, the anger and bitterness
waxed hotter. To quote Abul Fazl again: "The
Nakhazeen cursed and insulted the visitors to the
tomb of the Blessed Perfection," so that there was
danger of its desecration. "Consequently Abbas
Effendi asked the local (Turkish) Government to
supply a guard to accompany and protect" his
party. Abbas also went to Tiberias and made complaint
to the Government there.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> As a result of all
these conditions, "The people of hostility and violation,"
says Abul Fazl, "availed themselves of political
machinations," in other words, Mohammed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Ali's party, "those dwellers in hellfire,"<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> appealed
to the "fanatical men of those lands," <i>i.e.</i>, those
same Turkish Authorities. Mohammed Ali formally
complained to the Governor of Damascus, Nazim
Pasha, sending Mirza Majd-ud-Din as his special
messenger.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> They accused Abbas of retaining their
stipends, of confiscating their patrimony, including
the father's gold watch which had been donated to
Mohammed Ali. Above all, according to the interesting
narrative of Abbas' sister, Bahiah Khanum,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a>
they made accusation that the shrine which was being
erected on Mount Carmel "was intended as a
fort, in which Abbas and his followers would intrench
themselves, defy the Government, and endeavour to
gain possession of this part of Syria." To use the
words of Abbas, they said that "he had hoisted the
banner of independence; upon that he had inscribed
'Ya Baha-ul Abha': that he had summoned all to
assemble that he might found a new monarchy."
Therefore "an inquisitorial body (a Commission)
was appointed by the Government. To them the
copartners of my brothers confirmed them (the reports)
and added to them."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> After the report of the
Commission and in consequence of these charges
and counter-charges of the "Greatest Branch of
God" and the "Mightiest Branch of God," a telegram was
received from the Sultan to the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
"issuing a firman, decreeing the original order, by
which Baha's family were confined within the walls
of Acca." After <i>nine</i> years of quarrelling (<i>nine</i> being
the sacred number of Bahais) this order was put
in force, 1901 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> They were still confined to Acca
in 1906 when I visited Haifa. I saw the shrine and
the fine residence of Baha at Haifa, just beside the
English Mission. It deserves to be emphasized that
the <i>cause of the Bahai leaders being restricted to Acca</i>
was not religious persecution by Moslems but <i>their
own quarrellings</i>.</p>

<p>So completely had the suspicions of Abdul Hamid's
government been aroused by their accusations against
each other that the death sentence was feared. Pilgrimages
were stopped and terror rested on the followers.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a>
Abdul Baha wrote to his American disciples
of these conditions in the following hyperbolic words:
"Verily, by God, I would not change this prison for
the throne nor for all the gardens of the earth. Verily
I hope to be suspended in the air, and that my breast
may become the target to be pierced by thousands
of bullets: or that I may be cast into the bottomless
seas or thrown into the wilderness.... If I
could taste the cup of the great martyrdom, my
greatest desire would be fulfilled. This is my utmost
aim, the animation of my spirit, the healing of
my bosom, the sight of my eyes." But when the establishment
of the Constitution in Turkey gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
freedom, he was quick to take advantage of it. He
went to Egypt and took up his residence there.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a></p>

<p>The history I have narrated above refutes these
various pretensions of Bahaism, its claims, its "great
swelling words" more forcibly than logic or the
judgments and opinions of myself and others. The
conduct of Abdul Baha and his followers towards
the brothers and their followers, as well as that of
Bahais to the Azalis, contradicts their fine professions
of toleration and love to all religions and all men.
Well may we exclaim with Professor Browne:
"Where is the restraining power, when they can
show such <i>bitter animosity</i> against those of their
own household!" The numbers of Bahais living at
Acca then was about ninety,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> and of them thirty<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> or
forty<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> were of the opponents of Abbas.</p>

<p>In Persia, where Bahais number a hundred thousand,
a small, but influential minority rejected the
authority of Abbas Effendi. These were placed under
the ban, anathematized, and ostracized. For example,
one of them, Mirza Jalil of Khoi, was driven
out of his house, which was destroyed by Shiahs,
instigated by new Bahais. Another adherent of
Mohammed Ali, Mirza Khalil of Tabriz, was completely
ostracized, according to command received
from Acca. His daughter, who was married to a
new Bahai, was allowed to visit her parents only once
a year, though living in the same city, and when she
died they did not give them word till six days after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the funeral. Another Bahai libelled this man to his
employers in hope of injuring him.</p>

<p>Another result in Persia was the permanent estrangement
of a considerable number of Bahais who
lapsed into scepticism.</p>

<p>Abbas Effendi, influenced by the opposition, put a
veil over his high claims and instructed his followers
to speak of him as simply Abdul Baha, "the Servant
of Baha," which is usually translated by them "the
servant of God." The protesters replied, "Rather
let the title be Abdul-Hawa, 'the servant of air,'"
<i>i.e.</i>, windy and bombastic. But notwithstanding his
disavowals Abdul Baha allows himself to be assigned
a position both inconsistent with his own words and
with the teachings of Baha. Mr. Phelps, his disciple
and biographer, says,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> "Abdul Baha, styled 'Our
Lord,' 'Our Master,' is regarded with a love and a
<i>veneration</i> second only, <i>if indeed second</i>, to that
which they bestow upon Baha Ullah. He is classed
as the third or last of the Divine Messengers of the
present Dispensation." The Bab, Baha and Abbas
constitute, as it were, the Bahai trinity. Abdul Baha
commended and approved for publication an ode
written by Thornton Chase in which he is glorified
with the following epithets among many others.</p>

<p>"O Thou Enlightener of the Spirits of Men!
Thou Heart of the World!</p>

<p>"Thou Physician of Souls! Thou Prince of Peace!</p>

<p>"Thou Right Arm of the Almighty! Thou Lord
of the Sabbath of Ages!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou Mystery of God!"</p>

<p>Another disciple, Mrs. Grundy,<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> writes, "Abdul
Baha is the Bazaar of God, where everything humanity
needs may be found without money and without
price." Mr. Remey (a Bahai) writes,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> "The
Divine Spirit is manifested in Abdul Baha&mdash;<i>the
Branch</i>. He is the unique channel through which
the Power of God is conveyed to each individual believer.
He is the intermediary. The spiritual well-being
of every Bahai depends on his connection with
Abdul Baha."</p>

<p>The outcome of this quarrel in America is told in
the following chapter. An interesting sequel is the
recantation of Mirza Badi Ullah. Doubtless helped
thereto by poverty, he made his submission to Abdul
Baha, and published a confession, called "An Epistle
to the Bahai World." Concerning it Doctor Pease
told me that Badi Ullah is not the author of the
whole of that which is published in English under
his name. The Epistle says, I Badi Ullah "turn my
face to the appointed station, Abdul Baha&mdash;May the
life of all existent beings be a sacrifice to Him."
Against M. Mohammed Ali, with whom he had associated
himself for a decade, he makes accusation
of untrustworthiness, of purloining the papers and
books of Baha and interpolating and falsifying them,
of cursing and execrating Abdul Baha through jealousy.
He turns on his former supporters and says,
"they (the Nakhazeen) have no God save passion,
no object save personal interest."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> Doctor Jessup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
says:<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> "Badi not long ago was threatening to kill
Abbas, and assassination is an old fashion of Persian
fanatics.... He has become reconciled but I
would not guarantee that his main object is not to
gain his share of the money." Better had Badi stuck
to his former plan when he petitioned the Governor
of Damascus and the Sultan to be sent as a prisoner
to Rhodes. Doubtless then he would have had an
independent pension.</p>

<p class="h2">Bahaism in America</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>I speak from the point of view of Persian Bahaism and not from
that American fantasy which bears its name.&mdash;<i>Nicolas, "B&eacute;yan
Persan," Vol. I, p. II.</i></p>

<p>Abbas is an elderly and venerable man, very similar to a score
of venerable Druse and Moslem Sheikhs I have met....
The Lord deliver them (American Christians) from the delirious
blasphemies.... The claim that the Acca Sheikh is God is
quite enough to condemn them.&mdash;<i>H. H. Jessup, "Fifty-three
Years in Syria," p. 638.</i></p>

<p>Pray for my return to America and say: O Baha Ullah! Confirm
Him in the servitude of the East; so that He may not spend
all his time in the Orient; that He may return to America and occupy
His time in the Western world.&mdash;<i>Prayer of Bahais.</i></p>

<p>It is doubtless this mystical, allegorical character of Bahaism
which attracts a certain type of mind in America, in the main
probably, the same type which follows after spiritualism, esoteric
Buddhism, Swamis from India, theosophy, and other movements
which play around the edges of the occult and magical, and help to
dull the edge of present realities with the things which are neither
present nor real.... Indeed it is probably this soft compliance
with anything and the absence of the robustness of definite
truth and solid principle which makes Bahaism attractive to many
moral softlings in the West.... It will run a brief course
and amount to little in America.... The novelty will soon
be over and the people who did not have sufficient discernment to
discover the truth that will satisfy them in Christianity, will not find
it in Baha Ullah or Abbas Effendi.&mdash;<i>R. E. Speer, "Miss. and
Mod. Hist.," Vol. I, pp. 143, 162-168.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">BAHAISM, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> distinguished from Babism, was,
to a certain extent, introduced to public notice
in America by Christian missionaries,
who reported about it as a movement likely to break
the solidarity of Shiahism and facilitate the evangelization
of Persia. With the same thought in mind,
Professor Browne's translations of "The New History"
and "The Traveller's Narrative" attracted attention.
In the Congress of Religions, at the Chicago
Exposition in 1893, the eminent missionary, Rev.
H. H. Jessup, D. D., described Baha Ullah as "a
famous Persian sage,&mdash;the Babi saint, named Baha
Ullah (the glory of God), the head of that vast reform
party of Persian Moslems, who accept the New
Testament as the word of God and Christ as the deliverer
of men; who regard all nations as one and
all men as brothers."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Shortly after the Exposition
a Syrian, named Ibrahim G. Kheiralla, began a
propaganda in favour of Bahaism. He was of Christian
parentage, born in Mount Lebanon, and educated
in Beirut College. At Cairo, under the tutelage
of Mirza Karim of Teheran, he accepted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Bahai faith. He was engaged in business, to which
he joined faith healing and lecturing. He was given
a fake degree of Doctor of something by a night
school in Chicago. This he rightly despised, but considered
that he was entitled to the degree because
M. Mohammed Ali had addressed him as Doctor!
I had several interviews with him. He showed me
a trunk full of Bahai manuscripts and documents,
and allowed me to read his translation into English
of the "Kitab-ul-Akdas." He is a man of strong mind,
acute argumentative faculties, fine conversational
powers and altogether an interesting personality.
He first taught Bahaism in secret lessons, as a religion
of mysteries, a secret order, a doctrine for
truth-seekers only, not for the masses. "The secret
teaching gives us the key to the truth."<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></p>

<p>Mr. S. K. Vatralsky was among the private pupils
at Kenosha. He did not become a believer, but
learned the esoteric doctrine and published an interesting
account of the cult under the title, "Mohammedan
Gnosticism in America."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> Of the method
used he writes, "In their secret lessons they allegorize
and explain away; in public by means of mental
reservation and the use of words in a double sense,
they appear as they wish to appear." Doctor
Kheiralla published in 1897 a booklet called "Bab-ed-Din,
The Door of the True Religion&mdash;Revelation
from the East." It has two parts (1) On the Individuality
of God and (2) A Refutation of the Christian doctrine of the atonement. Later (1900), in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
conjunction with Mr. Howard MacNutt, he published
"Beha Ullah" in two volumes. It is the
theology and apologetics of Bahaism. Its Preface
informs us that its purpose is to "demonstrate that
the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, has appeared
in human form and established His kingdom
on earth." The propaganda met with considerable
success in Chicago and its vicinity. In 1897 Doctor
Kheiralla went to New York City and in a short
time "140 souls" were persuaded. In this same
year two of his pupils were married in his house in
Chicago, receiving his blessing. These were Mr.
and Mrs. E. C. Getsinger. They "taught seekers"
in Ithaca, N. Y., and afterwards in California. There
they converted Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;, a woman of great wealth,
to the faith. Mr. Vatralsky narrates that Doctor
Kheiralla converted no less than 2,000 Americans
during the first two years of his labour. Of these
700 were living in Chicago (Doctor Kheiralla told
me 840), between 250 and 300 in Wisconsin, about
400 in New York, the rest in Boston, etc. In his
"Beha Ullah" Doctor Kheiralla says, "Over seven
years ago I began to preach the message. Since
then thousands of people of this country have believed
and accepted the glad tidings of the appearance
of the Lord of Hosts, the Incarnation of Deity,
and the glorious message is rapidly spreading in
the United States." Speaking of this period Mr.
Vatralsky writes: "It would not have had its success,
had it come flying its own native colours. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
has succeeded because, like a counterfeit coin, it has
passed for what it is not."</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred on May 6, 1906. Mr.
August J. Stenstrand was exscinded from the "First
Central Church of the Manifestation," because he
rejected Baha Ullah and accepted Subh-i-Azal. He
was led to this step by investigating the history as
recorded in Professor Browne's translations. He
subsequently published three pamphlets, "Calls to
Behaists" (1907, 1910, 1913) setting forth the claims
of Azal. I had interesting interviews with him in
1914.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1898-99 pilgrimages were organized
to visit the shrine and leaders at Acca.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> One
party consisted of Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;, who bore the expenses,
Doctor and Mrs. Kheiralla, Mr. and Mrs.
Getsinger, Mr. Hadad and others. The pilgrimage
turned out unfortunately. They found the "holy
household" divided. They saw only Abbas Effendi
and one sister. They were kept from even a sight
of the others. Doctor Kheiralla was bold enough to
dispute with Abbas Effendi and he told me that for
this reason the latter conceived a grudge against
him. Of this Dr. F. O. Pease writes: "Doctor
Kheiralla had some discussion with Abbas in the
presence of native guests and teachers at which
Abbas took umbrage."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> The Getsingers accused
Kheiralla of immoral conduct and Abbas Effendi reported
these stories to Mrs. Kheiralla and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
daughter, with the result that they repudiated
Kheiralla.  Certain financial irregularities of the
party further disgusted Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;and chilled her
faith. So animosity and dissension sprang up.</p>

<p>Mr. Getsinger, on his return to America, announced
that he was to be the representative of Abbas Effendi,
because Doctor Kheiralla's teachings were erroneous
and his conduct immoral. Doctor Kheiralla responded
with counter charges against his accuser,
of a private and personal nature, and declared him
qualified for the Ananias club by his accounts of
himself in California. The Chicago and Kenosha
assemblies were rent asunder. In the correspondence,
some of which I have in my possession, they
hurl at each other such terms as falsehood, lie,
malevolence, injustice, maliciousness, deluding, laying
traps, etc. Thornton Chase was accused of dishonesty
in money matters. Doctor N&mdash;&mdash;, the treasurer
of the "Assembly" in Chicago, was denounced
for embezzling its funds. Mirza Abdul Karim arrived
from Acca to quiet matters but he poured oil on the
flames. Kheiralla was first informed that if he would
submit and co&ouml;perate, "he would never want anything."
He writes:<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> "Abdul Karim promised me
plenty of money, and when I refused, he denounced
me and prohibited believers from buying or reading
my book." He ordered a social and business boycott
against him and his party. Stenstrand says,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">610</a>
"They have ousted, given bad names, and thrown
mud at each other both in their sermons and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
print worse than any Christian or heathen religions
have done." The spirit of Abdul Karim may be
seen from one of his addresses: "O nakhiz (violator),
thou spotted snake, thou shalt be seized with a great
torture and punishment and thou, O sister serpent,
who art wagging thy sinuous way and trailing thy
deceitful slime over another region, know thy fate."
He declared that he would call to God for vengeance
against Kheiralla. Hasan Khorasani, too, threatened
him, saying, "He would be smitten of God in
two weeks," and "a sword shall cleave the sky and
cut his neck." He was greatly frightened. Doctor
Pease said to him, "Do not be afraid, you have
nothing to fear." Kheiralla answered him, "I know
these Orientals better than you do. I know what
they did to the Azalis." Before they came to the
next discussion, he had policemen concealed in his
house for his protection. The upshot of the whole
matter was that protesters repudiated Abbas Effendi,
after a conference in Chicago on May 27, 1900, finding
"increasing evidence of falsity and double dealing
in him." Indeed, says Doctor Pease, "Why
should we not inquire whether Abbas is not <i>a</i> son, if
not <i>the</i> son of perdition." They entered into correspondence
and became one with the party of M. Mohammed
Ali. After this the controversy took on a
doctrinal aspect and all questions of Abbas' supremacy
and misconduct were thrashed out between
the American Behaists and Bahais. This controversy
from the side of the Behaists is contained in
"The Three Questions" and "Facts for Behaists"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
(Chicago, 1901); from the other side in "Letters of
Abdul Baha Abbas to the Friends in Persia" and
"An Epistle to the Bahai World," by M. Badi Ullah,
after his recantation. The details of the schism have
been given already. To heal the schism different
leaders were sent to America successively by Abbas
Effendi. Following M. Abdul Karim, came M. Asad
Ullah, 1901. He published, in New York, "The
Sacred Mysteries" in which he anathematizes the
Behaists. He organized a "House of Justice" in
Chicago, a step which had been previously taken by
the other party. Next came the learned Mirza Abul
Fazl, 1901-1902. But their efforts were unavailing
though each was willing to acknowledge the faults
of his predecessor. The quarrel gave a great setback
to the cause. Doctor Pease wrote in 1902:<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">611</a>
"About 1,700 have left us because of the dissension
and false teaching, and because they would not engage
in religious scandal. The whole number in
the country is now 600 or 700. Of these 300 are
Behaists; the others are Abbasites of one sect or another,
holding belief that Abbas is Lord and Master."
Doctor Kheiralla says, "Many grew cold, few remained."
With this agrees the word of Thornton
Chase:<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> "We have seen too many, when the first
winds of testing blew, show faith of shallow depth."
Abdul Baha says:<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> "Chicago, in comparison with
the cities of America, was in advance and numerically
contained more Bahais, but when the stench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
or vile odour of the Nakhazeen was spread in that
city there was stagnation." In Chicago Bahaism
never recovered from these quarrels. In 1914 Mr.
F. A. Slack, "Spiritual Guide of the Behaist Assembly
of Kenosha," wrote to me "of the bitter invectives
and false accusations and persecutions we
are subjected to" by the followers of Abbas Effendi.
The Behaists had dwindled to 40, according to their
own report to the U. S. Census in 1906, while the
Bahais reported 1,280 in U. S. A. of whom 492 were
in Illinois, 23 in two Assemblies in New York State,
58 in New Jersey, 52 in Pennsylvania. One of the
largest Assemblies was in Washington, D. C., with
74 members, white and coloured. These organized
local "spiritual assemblies" were 27 in 1913, a very
small increase.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> There are also "assemblies of teaching"
for the women. There are Annual Conventions
with delegates from the different groups.
These conventions are "unique and peerless among
the assemblies of mankind," in the mind of their
imaginative reporter, "because of the divine favour
of Baha Ullah which gathers them together....
All other meetings in the world are for worldly or
selfish purposes. These alone are spiritual."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> They
also hold a summer conference at Eliot, Maine.</p>

<p>The Bahai propaganda is carried on by means of
these assemblies, by parlour meetings, by personal
intercourse and by letters (tablets) from Abdul Baha.
Their publicity bureau is most active and supplies
many articles to magazines and newspapers. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
make use of the Chautauquas, Peace Congresses, etc.,
to promulgate their peculiar tenets. Their press at
Chicago publishes the <i>Star of the West</i>, formerly the
<i>Bahai News</i>. It is issued monthly, that is, every
nineteen days, according to the Bahai calendar. For
example, the issue of September 27, 1914, is dated
Masheyat 1, Year 70. It is printed in English and
Persian, the latter being lithographed. It is confined
to Bahai subjects, giving many of Abdul Baha's
"revelations." Their literature, so far issued, is
(1) The Works of Baha Ullah, in six or more books.
(2) The Tablets and Addresses of Abdul Baha.
(3) The Apologetics of Bahai writers, American or
translations from the Persian. (4) Journals of pilgrims
to Acca. (5) Tracts and reports. Of his own
Tablets, Abdul Baha says:<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> "In course of time, the
light of these Tablets will dawn, the greatness, the
importance will be known. The truth I say unto
thee, that each leaflet will be a wide-spread book,
nay rather a glistening Gem on the Glorious Crown.
Know then its value and hold great its station."
These Tablets are, for the most part, letters to individuals.</p>

<p>Besides the Bahai Publishing Society, another
agency is the Orient-Occident Unity,&mdash;first organized
in 1909 as the Persian American Educational
Society. It has a commercial side, but its
main object is to promote Bahaism by assisting or
opening schools and hospitals in Persia and other
Oriental countries. It has started mission work in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Teheran, Tabriz, Meshed and other points in Persia
and in Burmah. They seek to strengthen Bahaism
in Persia where it is small and weak in comparison
with other sects. The work of the American Bahais
there is of little importance. "But the presence of
American Bahais in Persia or the value of an American
newspaper is not their direct influence, but the
impression they give that America has largely accepted
Bahaism."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> In the United States this Unity
poses as philanthropical, not revealing in its constitution,
circulars and appeals for funds its Bahai
connection. This concealment is inexcusable and
cannot be too strongly condemned. Christians and
Jews should not be asked to contribute to any cause
under false pretenses, nor should prominent statesmen,
educators and philanthropists be thus led to
give their quasi endorsement to the Society.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></p>

<p>In 1912 Abdul Baha Abbas, after a sojourn in France
and England, visited America, arriving April 12 and
departing December 5. America has not lacked its
own prophetic product, as witness Joseph Smith,
Mary Eddy, John Dowie, Crowdy and Indian medicine
men. But Abdul Baha, except for Hindu Swamis,
was the first Asiatic revelator America has received.
Its hospitality showed up well. The public and
press neither stoned the "prophet" nor caricatured
him but looked with kindly eye upon the grave old
man, in flowing oriental robes and white turban,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with waving hoary hair and long white beard.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> His
visit was noticed, as has been the case with many
distinguished foreigners, but did not create any
special sensation. His own press agents were active
and aggressive, furnishing many articles for newspapers
and magazines. The reporters took the exaggerated
statements of the Bahais without sifting.
He performed his part fairly well and allowed himself
to be interviewed and photographed with the
patience of an actress. He posed for the "movies"
man and spoke for the phonograph records. He sat
for an oil painting and approved of his bust in
marble.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a></p>

<p>Abdul Baha's tour comprised a number of the
chief cities of the northeast, followed by a rest at
Green Acre Conference, Eliot, Maine, and then a
trip to Canada and California. His meetings and
addresses were of two kinds: for the public and for
the Bahais. He spoke to the churches, liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and evangelical,<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> Socialists, Theosophists, etc.; to
Woman's Clubs, Suffragists, Colleges, Historical
Societies, Peace Societies and at the Conference on
International Arbitration, at Lake Mohonk.</p>

<p>Abdul Baha's principle in his public addresses was
"to talk about things upon which we agree and say
nothing about things upon which we differ."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> Thus
he spoke much of the Fatherhood of God, but failed
to mention that he regarded Baha Ullah as "the
Manifestation of the Father." He spoke of brotherly
love extensively yet never about the violent quarrels
that abound in Bahai annals. He said much of
religious unity<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> but did not state how the movement
had increased the number of sects in Persia and in
America. He spoke much on "Universal peace,"
though Babi history, which they boast of, has some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of the cruelest and bloodiest conflicts of arms recorded
in history. He dwelt much on the principle of arbitration,
though he had refused to arbitrate his dispute
with Mohammed Ali. Even while he was in
America, a grandson of Baha Ullah, who lives near
Chicago, sent a request for an interview to lead to a
reconciliation. Abdul Baha ignored the request.
He discoursed at length on woman's rights and
equality, but omitted to inform the public that Baha
Ullah had three wives and carefully concealed his
women in an oriental haram. Besides all these, he
erroneously attributed to Baha Ullah the origination
of teachings which have been the age-long possession
of Christendom.</p>

<p>The meetings with the believers were of a different
character. To them his message was: "Teach
Bahaism; work for the cause; spread the faith; build
the Temple." With them he celebrated the Unity
Feast. This has some of the features of the <i>agape</i>
of the ancient Church and some of the Lord's Supper.
Often a variety of food is partaken, Persian
pilau being a favourite. When all were seated
Abdul passed through the rooms, speaking:<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> "Abdul
Baha is now walking among you commemorating
Baha Ullah. Blessed are ye who are the servants of
Baha Ullah. In the utmost of love I greet each and
all of you. This is like the Lord's Supper. Material
food is prepared for you. The manna from heaven
is present for you. May your hearts be exhilarated
in the kingdom of Abha. The labours of Baha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Ullah have not been in vain." After the Feast, he
raised his hands and pronounced his blessing upon
them. This is called the 19th day Unity Feast and
is celebrated at the beginning of every Bahai month.
When Abdul Baha is not present the Tablets are read
and praises to Baha, as to God, are chanted.</p>

<p>One incident was the establishment of the Day of
Thornton Chase as a memorial anniversary. Chase
is the first American Bahai to be canonized. Abdul
Baha visited his grave at Los Angeles, and ordained
a saint's day in the Bahai calendar, October 19th.
He said:<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> "This revered personage was the first
Bahai believer in America. He served the cause
faithfully and his services will be ever remembered
throughout ages and cycles."<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> "He was of the
blessed souls.... He witnessed the light of the
kingdom of Abha and wrote proofs and evidences of
the Manifestation." Thornton Chase certainly had
a surprising faith in Abdul Baha.</p>

<p>A special event was the dedication of the grounds
of the Bahai Temple, the Mashrak-ul-Azkar (the
Dawning-place of Praises). This took place in the
midst of the Rizwan Feast, on May 1, 1912, in the
presence of the Bahai Temple Unity composed of
delegates from all the "spiritual assemblies" in
America, convened in its fourth annual convention.
A site of five acres has been purchased in the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of Willmette, a suburb of Chicago. Abdul Baha,
using a golden trowel, broke ground and others of
the different races, who were present, used picks and
shovels and prepared a place into which Abdul Baha
put a stone. He said: "The mystery of this building
is great. It cannot be unveiled yet, but its erection
is the most important undertaking of this day.
This Temple of God in Chicago will be to the
spiritual body of the world what the inrush of the
spirit is to the physical body of man, quickening it to
its utmost parts and infusing a new light and power....
Its results and fruits are endless." Of the
structure he said: "The Mashrak-ul-Azkar will be
like a beautiful bouquet. The central lofty edifice
will have nine sides, surrounded by nine avenues
interlacing nine gardens where nine fountains will
play. There will be nine gateways and columns,
with nine arches and nine arched windows and nine
caissons nine feet in diameter. Nine will also be
carried out in the galleries and dome. Further, its
meetings are to be held on the ninth of each month."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>
Thus the Bahai sacred number will be exhibited
everywhere. "Behold!" exclaims the Bahai reporter.
"What a priceless piece of ground is this
site, dedicated by the hands of the Orb of the
Covenant and blessed by his holy feet."<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> But in another
place Abdul Baha urges them to hasten the
completion of the building, complaining<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> "America
has not been working enough for it." "Money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
comes slowly," says the treasurer; "pledges were
tremendous&mdash;as big as our eyes saw at the time and
afterwards we could collect<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> only a small proportion."
After six years of strenuous pleading and effort,
they have paid for the ground. The ladies evidently
preferred to spend their money in jaunts to Acca,
with Paris and Cairo en route, rather than to put up
an extravagant temple in Chicago for 200 people
who are scattered in that city&mdash;a temple in which the
believers in New York and Los Angeles may never
worship. The cause for haste is "to fulfill a great
prophecy, that in the day of the Branch shall the
temple of the Lord be built" (Zech. vi. 12). And
Abdul Baha is already more than seventy. When
finished, "It will have an effect on the whole world."
"It will be dedicated to the worship of Baha Ullah
and his words only are to be read in it."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a></p>

<p>After a sojourn of about eight months, Abdul Baha
returned to England, whence he telegraphed:
"Thanks to Baha Ullah, I arrived safely." As a
souvenir of the visit, the American Bahais presented
a silver vase to the shrine of Abdul Baha Ullah at
Acca, "the Holy City." Of this Mr. Remey writes:</p>

<p>"The Holy Tomb in which this vase is to repose
(we ardently hope) for hundreds, perhaps thousands
of years already contains precious offerings, vases
and many wonderful things placed there by people
from all over the world. Among this ever-growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
collection at the Threshold of the remains of the
Earthly Tabernacle of Him who manifested forth to
a dying world the very Fatherhood of the Eternal
of Him, who for us is the Sublime King of Kings,
must stand this silent token, as a measure of the response
from the hearts made glad by this ineffable
sacrifice of Him who, giving up all thoughts of self,
came to us (<i>i. e.</i>, to U. S. A.) in our need, The Centre
of the Covenant, His Holiness Abdul Baha."</p>

<p>The visit of Abdul Baha did not leave any great
impression. His personality had no deep influence.
He appeared conspicuous neither for intellectuality
nor spirituality. Many a distinguished traveller has
got hold of the public ear and heart to a greater extent.
I was in Baltimore when he was there. He caused
scarcely a ripple on the surface. His addresses were
tame and full of platitudes. It was told me that his
visit led to doubt and coldness on the part of some
adherents. He was, as Canon Wilberforce said, "not
an orator, nor even a preacher," practiced in public
address. One of the distinguished clergymen whose
pulpit he occupied said to me, "The man has no
special message. He is a faker." Another liberal
thinker, who has given publicity to this doctrine, after
an interview, pronounced him a fraud. Some of the
American disciples, especially the ladies, idolized him,
even to the extent of bringing down upon them the
reprobation of some English disciples. One of the
latter wrote:<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> "There seems to be a tendency in
America and elsewhere to focus too great attention on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Abdul Baha rather than upon the Manifistation."</p>

<p>What of the progress of Bahaism in America? It
is making no marked progress. In some sections it
seems to have gone forward, as on the Pacific coast
and around New York and Washington. It has decreased
in the South and in the headquarters of the
movement, Chicago. The organization at Atlanta
has disappeared from the list. The South will not
take kindly to the advocacy by Abdul Baha of the
miscegenation of the races. He recommends that
efforts be made towards the intermarriage of the
coloured and white races as the ideal panacea for the
present estrangement.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></p>

<p>I understand that a Washington negro has married
an English Bahai woman, the courtship having
occurred when both were pilgrims, and under the
encouragement of Abdul Baha. Of the condition of
the cause in Chicago I can speak from personal investigation.
I attended the regular Sunday service
in St. John's room, eighteenth floor of the Masonic
Hall. It was a pleasant May day. About sixty
were present&mdash;twenty men and forty women. I
questioned the men and found that six of them were
Bahais and fourteen, like me, were visitors. The
man next to me on the right was a member of an
ethical culture society that meets on the twelfth floor.
I asked the man on my left to what organization he
belonged. He replied, "To the kingdom of God."
I inquired what was his opinion of Abbas Effendi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
He pulled from his pocket a much used New Testament
and pointed to the verse in Revelation which
refers to the beast and said, "That is he." I conversed
with several of the Bahai ladies, two of whom acted
as instructors of the meeting. The Sunday-school
held at an earlier hour, I learned, was a class in
Esperanto. To my question as to the number of
Bahais in Chicago, she replied "that Baha Ullah has
told us that there must be a falling away before the
triumph," from which I inferred that conditions were
not prosperous. The next man, a Bahai, told me the
number was about one hundred and fifty. The
leader, Mrs. C. True, told me about three hundred.
One of the opposing sect told me there are only
sixty, while his sect has lost all organization and
numbers only forty in the whole country. But if we
take the number at the highest estimate given, the
number is less than fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>I go into particulars regarding this point, because
there is a false impression abroad, in Europe and
Asia, an impression that is carefully fostered. Take
this incident. In Persia a Bahai affirmed before the
crowd that one-half of Chicago was Bahai. A Bible
colporteur disputed the statement and proposed to
telegraph to the Mayor of Chicago and inquire, and
whichever side was wrong should pay for the telegram.
The Bahai declined. In distant India a similar
impression is created for effect. Mr. Getsinger
wrote in the <i>Jam-i-Jamseed</i> of Bombay:<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> "The Bahai
faith has spread in America by leaps and bounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
<i>the number being beyond computation</i>." Strange
exaggeration, if you give it no worse name! Some
such a one was no doubt interviewed by the "wayfarer"
of the Continent and told him that there were
one million in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> But that well-informed
reporter put the number at 3,000. <i>The Star
of the West</i> (Feb. 7, 1912) says: "There are several
thousand Bahais in the United States." My own
conclusion is that there are 2,000 in twenty-seven organizations.
In 1906 they reported to the Census
1,280 members in twenty-four organizations. Most
of the members are women. (See Chap. VII.)</p>

<p>That the Bahai propaganda has nothing special to
boast of in the United States is evident when we
compare its results with those of other religious fads.
The Dowieites of Zion City (followers of John Dowie
who claimed to be the prophet Elijah) report seventeen
organizations in ten states with 5,865 members;
the Crowdyites (Crowdy was a negro cook who in
1906 claimed to be a prophet) report forty-eight
organizations and 1,823 members; Theosophists
eighty-five and 2,336 members; Vedantists (Swamiists)
four and 340 members; Spiritualists 455 with
35,056 members; Christian Scientists 638 and 85,000
members. Well may the Egyptian <i>Gazette</i> say:
"If Bahaism has found favour in the United States,
it cannot be forgotten that countless other 'religions'
have become popular there which would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
been taken seriously in any other country in the
world." Yet, aside from the Mormons, how few
they number altogether.</p>

<p>Is it not marvellous that clergy of various Protestant
churches, even of the Church of England,
have given the use of their edifices for its anti-Christian
proselytism? Roman Catholic churches have
not been open to it. And this happened not only
when Abdul Baha was a guest among our people
but is continued since. Surely such latitudinarianism
must grieve the heart of Christ even as it shocks
His faithful followers and gives boldness to those
who would hurl Him from His mediatorial throne.
It is unnecessary now to catalogue the various
Protestant pulpits and platforms in Great Britain,
and in America where, with readings from the
Bahai "revelations" and flattering introductions,
place was given to the "false Christ." But the disloyalty
still continues. Lately a missionary was a
speaker at a Woman's Foreign Missions Society
and was preceded by a lady advocating Bahaism.
In a late number of the <i>Star of the West</i> (April 9,
1914) is a picture of the St. Mark's-in-the-Bowerie
Episcopal Church, New York, with a notice that an
audience room had been granted in the parish house
for Bahai meetings every Sunday. This was followed
by a letter from Abdul Baha rejoicing in this
opportunity "to promulgate the principles of Baha
Ullah," and by a request for the prayers of all Bahais
that "through this opened door many hearts may
be turned to the 'Branch,'" <i>i. e.</i>, Abdul Baha. An<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>other issue contains an announcement<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> of the marriage
at Montreal of the editor, Doctor Bagdadi, to
Zeenat Khanum, both Persian Bahais of Mohammedan
antecedents. The narrative declares: "The
minister who officiated astonished all [even the
Bahais] by reading from the Bahai writings!"</p>

<p>The Bahais still continue to proselyte through
Ethical Culture and Theosophic Societies and on
the platform of peace congresses. Is it not full time
that Christian people and churches should cease to
give countenance to this system which is an enemy
of the cross of Christ, and which has already deceived
several thousands of our fellow Christians?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_620_620" id="Footnote_620_620"></a><a href="#FNanchor_620_620"><span class="label">620</span></a> Myron Phelps states (p. 97) that Abbas Effendi wishes no photographs
of himself taken. This is certainly a mistake as years ago they were
circulated in Persia and purchasable in the bazaar. The account of his
posing for the motion pictures is amusing. When requested to pass before
the camera, he at once replied, "Khaili khob" (very good). The
Bahais present were very much upset and protested that his picture would
be scattered all over the country in the movies. He replied, "Busiar
khob" (still better). Later, in June, an extended motion picture was
taken. The scenes were somewhat spoiled by Abdul Baha not remaining
in focus and disarranging the scenario. These films, with words, are
being used in the Sunday services of the Bahais and are to be used in the
Orient in connection with the voice record on the Edison talking machine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_621_621" id="Footnote_621_621"></a><a href="#FNanchor_621_621"><span class="label">621</span></a> Mr. Remey said to him: "We expected an attitude of hostility
towards you from the clergy and theologians. We did not expect the
churches and religious societies would open their doors" (<i>S. W.</i>, March
21, 1913, p. 18). Doctor Cadman of Brooklyn explained his inviting
Abdul Baha to preach in his pulpit by saying, "Christian people can
afford to be absolutely free and catholic in their extension of liberty and
courtesy to other people." Yet most Christians were grieved and consider
it disloyalty to Christ.</p></div>

of Abdul Baha written shortly before his visit to America (<i>S. W.</i>, May 17,
1811). "In view of the differences among the friends and the lack of
unity among the maid servants of the Merciful, how can Abdul Baha
hasten to those parts? Is it possible? No, by God!" "Your worthless
imaginations, backbiting, and faultfinding enable the Nakhazeen to
spread a noose for you." The Americans could reply, "Physician, heal thyself,"
for the worst anger and discord have been between the brothers at
Acca. And he himself continues to cry out, "Hold aloof from the
violators."</p></div>

<p>The story of the first seventeen centuries of Christianity is
here told in the lives of the great missionaries of the church
beginning with St. Paul. So far as we are aware no single
volume containing so complete a collection of the lives of these
pioneers in missionary work has before been published.
Miss Stubbs has done a very real and important service to
the cause of missions in making the lives of these great men
live for the inspiration of younger generations of to-day.</p>

<p>The author is Secretary of the Medical Mission Auxiliary

<p>"This is a magnificent presentation of the call of missions,
showing their great and sweeping influence on human life
and social progress. It is a logical and searching study of
the power of the Gospel as it goes into other lands and there
meets the facts and elements that make up the life of the
people. Dr. Dennis has had the personal experiences and
knowledge which enable him to speak with authority. An
exceedingly valuable contribution to the missionary literature

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
